"""Showing a whole run as one picture without copying a single pixel of it.

Why this exists
---------------

:mod:`zmart_storage.cropped` hands the viewer one picture by **writing the run a
second time**: every tile goes into the archive whole, and a trimmed copy of it
goes into a canvas. That works, it is measured, and at the sizes this project has
reached so far the extra disk is an easy price.

At five terabytes it stops being a price and becomes a refusal. A run that size
cannot be copied in order to be looked at — there is not the disk, and the copying
itself would take long enough to change how the instrument is used.

This module is the other way of getting one picture. Nothing at full resolution is
copied. The view is a **list of pointers** into the tiles that already exist, and
the viewer is told those pointers describe a single, ordinary image.

The one idea it rests on
------------------------

A zarr image is stored as a grid of equal pieces, one file each. If a piece of the
*view* happens to be exactly a piece of one *tile*, byte for byte, then answering a
request for it is not assembling anything — it is handing over a file that already
exists on disk. No arithmetic is done on the pixels at all.

That is what this module arranges, and it is arithmetic rather than cleverness.
Two conditions have to hold, and both are checked here rather than assumed:

- **Where a tile lands in the view is a whole number of pieces**, so that the
  tile's own grid of pieces and the view's line up instead of being half a piece
  out;
- **the part of the tile the view shows is a whole number of pieces too**, so that
  the first piece the view asks for is a whole piece of the tile rather than a
  window straddling two.

Run with tiles that butt up against one another — the stage stepping by a whole
tile — both conditions hold for free, because the part shown is the whole tile and
tiles land a whole tile apart. A run whose tiles overlap can satisfy them as well,
but only if the pieces are small enough to divide the trim; see the table in
``zmart-viewer/LINKING_INSTEAD_OF_COPYING.md``, which works that through.

The limit to know about before using this
-----------------------------------------

A tile has to land on a piece boundary *exactly*. A stage asked to step 1792 voxels
steps 1792 give or take a couple, which is a fine result for the microscope and a
fatal one here: two voxels out is as fatal as half a piece out, because the bytes
wanted are then spread across two of the tile's files and no single file can be
handed over. Nothing that can be written in the description gets round this — zarr
describes an image as one regular grid, so a view can keep a tile's true position
or hand over its files untouched, but not both.

What this module does about it today is **refuse**, with a message saying what to
change. That is honest and it is safer than drawing a tile slightly out of place
with nothing on screen to say so, but it does mean this opens the exact grids the
tests build and not yet a run off a real stage.
``zmart-viewer/LINKING_INSTEAD_OF_COPYING.md`` describes the arrangement that fixes
it — giving each piece of the view to whichever tile covers it best, so the seam
lands on a piece boundary near the midline instead of exactly on it.

What still has to be written, and why
-------------------------------------

**The zoomed-out copies.** A viewer that is zoomed out draws a smaller copy of
the picture. Because shrinking picks every second voxel rather than averaging —
see ``canvas.py`` — a voxel of a smaller copy comes from exactly one tile, so a
tile that carries its own zoomed-out copies can be pointed at when zoomed out
exactly as at full size, and a run that lines up all the way down writes nothing
at all.

How far down the pointers go is worked out from the run rather than demanded of
it. Shrinking counts voxels from the picture's own corner, so pointing at a copy
shrunk N times needs every tile to begin on a grid N times coarser than the
pieces — and the deepest copies of a small tile are stored in pieces smaller
than its full-size ones, which a large view cannot hand over either. The view
points as deep as both conditions hold and **writes the copies below that**,
which refuses nobody and costs at most about a quarter of the full-size picture
in disk: each copy holds a quarter as many voxels as the one above, and a
quarter plus a sixteenth and so on comes to a third, measured at around 26% on a
real run. Copying the run instead costs about eighty per cent more disk. A run
that lines up one level deep pays ~7%, two levels deep ~2%, and all the way
down nothing.

**The description.** The viewer asks what the image is before it asks for any of
it: its axes, its size, how large a voxel is, where it sits on the stage, what
copies it has. None of that exists anywhere until this module works it out, and
almost all of it is read back out of the tiles themselves rather than being
supplied again — a view that had to be told the voxel size could be told the wrong
one, and nothing about the picture would say so.

**The list of pointers**, which is written beside the picture as a small file
called ``zmart-links.json``. It says, for each tile, which pieces of the view that
tile supplies and which of its own pieces they are. The viewer's server reads it;
see ``zmart-viewer/app/server/linking.py``, which is the other half of this and is where
the file's shape is written down for the reader.

What is refused, and why it is refused loudly
---------------------------------------------

Bytes are handed over untouched, so the view's description has to agree with what
the tiles really contain — the kind of number a voxel is, what it is compressed
with, what an unwritten piece means, and which generation of zarr wrote it. A
disagreement there does not produce an error; it produces a picture of noise, or a
picture that is silently wrong. So every tile's storage description is compared
with every other's and with the view's own, exactly, and anything that does not
match is refused before a single pointer is written.

What this does not do
---------------------

It does not stitch, blend, or move anything by a fraction of a voxel — all of those
change pixels, and a pointer cannot change a pixel. And it does not follow a run as
it happens: the view is built from the tiles that exist when it is built.

Tiles that bundle their pieces
------------------------------

OME-Zarr 0.5 allows an image to keep many pieces inside one file, with a small index
saying where each of them begins. That is *sharding*, and it exists because a large
run otherwise leaves millions of small files behind, which most filesystems and most
backup software handle badly.

A view can be built over such tiles, and nothing about the idea changes — what gets
handed over is simply the bundle rather than a single piece. The viewer's engine
reads the bundle's index itself and asks for one piece out of the middle by byte
offset, which the server answers as an ordinary range of a file.

Two things follow that are worth knowing before choosing a bundle size. The view is
declared with the tiles' own bundling, because a view stored differently from its
tiles is a picture of noise. And **the bundle becomes the unit everything is
measured in**: a tile has to begin on a whole bundle boundary rather than merely a
whole piece boundary, and the smallest strip that can be trimmed off a tile where it
overlaps its neighbour is a whole bundle. Bundles that are too large therefore make
the placement harder to satisfy, not easier.

    Everything the view declares about itself is read out of the tiles — how large a
    voxel is, what the colours are called, how the picture is stored, how many
    moments and colours there are — so there is nothing to state twice and get
    different both times.

    What this writes is small and is listed here so it is not a surprise: the view's
    description, its progressively smaller copies, and the list of pointers. The
    full-size picture is not written at all.

    Args:
        folder: the run's own folder, which is where the view is put. The tiles do
            not have to live in it, but they normally do — beside it, in the folder
            of whole tiles the acquisition wrote.
        tiles: the tiles, with where each of them lands in the view. See
            :class:`PlacedTile`.
        name: what to call the view. The image is named after it, and it is what the
            operator sees as the heading in the viewer's panel.
        view_shape: how large the picture is, as ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels. Left out,
            it is exactly big enough for the tiles given, which is usually right.
            Give it when the run means to declare the stage's whole travel range so
            that tiles arriving later still land inside the picture.
        levels: how many progressively smaller copies to keep, counting the
            full-size one. Normally left out, so that the same reckoning an ordinary
            canvas uses decides it from the size of the picture.
        discard_existing_run: whether to throw away a view already built in this
            folder under this name. The tiles are never touched either way.
        keeps_its_tiles_in: where *inside* the view the tiles live: the name of
            a subfolder such as ``"positions"``, or ``"."`` to say the tiles sit
            directly among the view's own levels with nothing between. Left out
            — the usual arrangement — the view is a folder beside the tiles and
            each is separate.

            Giving it says the view and its tiles are one thing on disk, here
            in the direct arrangement::

                plate.ome.zarr/          <- open this; it is one whole picture
                  zarr.json              <- what the picture is, and the map
                  0/ 1/ 2/ 3/            <- the levels: pointed ones hold nothing
                  pos00000.ome.zarr/     <- a complete image in its own right
                  pos00001.ome.zarr/

            A tile living directly inside must be named ending ``.ome.zarr`` —
            that ending is what the writer's emptying sweep steps around — and
            this is checked rather than trusted.

            The reason to want it is that there is then **one folder to open, to
            move and to copy**, and nothing of a run can be separated from the
            rest of it by accident. Each position inside stays an ordinary
            OME-Zarr image that opens perfectly well on its own, and no picture is
            copied to achieve any of this.

            What it costs is that deleting that one folder now deletes the
            acquisition rather than only the view. The writer is careful about the
            half of that it can control — ``discard_existing_run`` clears the
            view's description and leaves the positions exactly as they are — but
            nothing can help with an operator deleting the folder in a file
            manager. Weigh that against the tidiness before choosing it.

            The tiles must really be inside that subfolder, and this is checked:
            a view that claimed to hold its tiles and did not would be a folder
            you could copy and find empty at the far end.

    Returns:
        A :class:`LinkedView` saying where the view is and what it points at.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the tiles were not all written the same way, if any of them
            would land somewhere other than on a whole piece boundary, if two of
            them disagree about where the view's corner is, or for any of the
            reasons :meth:`zmart_storage.canvas.TileCanvases.create` refuses a run.

    Use this while a run is being acquired. :func:`link_the_tiles` is for a run that
    has finished — it reads every tile and builds the whole view, which is right
    once and ruinous per tile.

    Args:
        folder: the run's own folder, which is where the view is put.
        like: one tile that shows what the rest will be like — an already written
            store, or a :class:`PlacedTile` naming one. Everything the view has to
            declare about itself is read from it: how large a voxel is, what the
            colours are called, the kind of number a voxel holds, how it is
            compressed, how large a piece is. Every tile added later has to match,
            and is refused if it does not.
        view_shape: how large the picture will be, as ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels. This
            has to be decided before the run because the viewer may be reading the
            description throughout. Across the specimen, the stage's travel range is
            a good choice: the stage cannot reach outside it, and declaring room
            costs no disk until something is imaged there. Depth is the exception —
            give it the depth the run means to image with a little to spare, for the
            reason set out in :meth:`zmart_storage.canvas.TileCanvases.create`.
        name: what to call the view. The operator sees it as the heading in the
            viewer's panel.
        levels: how many progressively smaller copies to keep, counting the
            full-size one. Normally left out, so the size of the picture decides.
        origin_um: where the picture's corner sits on the stage, in micrometres.
            Left out, it is taken from the tile given as ``like``, which is right
            when that tile is the run's first and lands at the picture's corner.
            Give it outright when it is not.
        discard_existing_run: whether to throw away a view already built here under
            this name.
        keeps_its_tiles_in: the name of a subfolder inside the view where the
            positions will be written, such as ``"positions"``. See
            :func:`link_the_tiles`, which describes the arrangement and what it
            costs.

            This is the comfortable way round to build it. The view is declared
            first, while its folder is still empty, and the run then writes each
            position into that subfolder and hands it to :meth:`add` as it lands.
            Nothing has to be moved afterwards, and the operator can open the
            folder and watch the picture fill in.
        point_at: how many copies of the picture to point at rather than write,
            counting the full-size one. Normally left out, which points as deep
            as the tiles' own copies go — the right choice for a run whose
            positions land on the coarse grid that needs (a multiple of the
            piece size times the largest shrink).

            Give a smaller number when the run's step does not divide that
            coarse grid. A growing view has to settle this before the first
            tile, because the copies below the pointed ones are written as
            tiles land and cannot be unwritten — so a tile arriving off the
            coarse grid is refused rather than accommodated, and the refusal
            says to start the view with this set lower. ``point_at=1`` always
            works: it points at the full-size picture only, and every zoomed-out
            copy is written, which any placement on whole pieces satisfies.

    Returns:
        A :class:`GrowingLinkedView`. Add tiles to it with
        :meth:`GrowingLinkedView.add` and close it with
        :meth:`GrowingLinkedView.finish`, or use it in a ``with`` block so it is

    """A view held open while the run is still arriving, so a tile landing is cheap.

    :func:`link_the_tiles` builds a view from the tiles that exist when it is
    called. That is right for a run that has finished, and wrong for one that has
    not: calling it again for each tile that lands costs as much as building the
    whole view, so a run of ten thousand tiles pays that ten thousand times over.
    Measured at six thousand four hundred tiles, one more tile cost 1.5 seconds,
    which across a whole acquisition is hours of work that produces nothing new.

    This is the same view, kept open. Adding a tile checks that one tile and writes
    that one tile's share of the zoomed-out copies, neither of which depends on how
    many tiles have already landed. Measured against rebuilding: about 4 ms for a
    tile rather than 1 500.

    The list of pointers used to be rewritten in full for every tile, which grew
    with the run — 89 ms for one tile once a view held six thousand four hundred of
    them. Tiles are now **added to the end of a companion file**, one line each, so
    nothing already written is touched and the cost does not depend on how many
    lines are already there. When the view is closed those lines are folded back
    into the list itself and the companion file goes away, so a finished view is a
    single file exactly like one built in a single call.

    Held open matters for a second reason. Everything that keeps a tile safe lives
    in the writer rather than on disk: which parts of the picture have been imaged,
    and which pieces are being written at this instant so that two tiles are never
    halfway through the same one. Closing and reopening throws that away, so the
    view is opened once for the run and closed once at the end of it.

    Use it with ``with``, so the view is closed even if the run fails::

            for tile in as_they_arrive():
                view.add(tile)

    The viewer may be open on the run throughout. It notices the list of pointers
    changing and reads it afresh, and the list is replaced in a single step, so a
    reader never catches it half-written.

    the arithmetic genuinely allows and writes the copies below that, which
