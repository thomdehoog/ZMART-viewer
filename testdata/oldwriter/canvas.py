"""Writing a tiled run into one large OME-Zarr image per acquisition type.

Why this exists
---------------

A smart-microscopy run can visit thousands of places on the stage. If every one
of those becomes its own OME-Zarr folder, the viewer has thousands of separate
images to open, describe, and keep track of — and that cost is paid again every
time a new tile lands, not just once at the start. Measured on this repository's
own test rig, one tile arriving took 0.1 seconds when 25 tiles were open, 0.3
seconds at 100, and 3.7 seconds at 225. The trend does not survive a run of a
few thousand.

The way out is to stop giving the viewer one image per position. Instead each
acquisition type — the overview, the prescan, the targetscan — writes into **one
large image** whose size is declared before any imaging begins. The viewer then
has a handful of things to keep track of no matter how big the run gets, and a
tile arriving costs nothing at all to notice, because the image's description
never changes — only chunks of picture appear underneath it.

Declaring a large image up front is affordable because a piece of an image only
occupies disk once something writes to it. An image can honestly declare the
whole stage travel range and occupy almost nothing until it is filled in.

Tiles must not overlap, and what that costs
-------------------------------------------

One image holds exactly one value per voxel. So if two tiles cover the same
ground, the second to arrive simply replaces the strip they share, and the first
recording of that strip is gone at the moment of writing — silently, because the
picture that results looks perfectly ordinary.

This writer therefore asks for an acquisition whose tiles butt up against one
another: the stage steps by a whole tile, so no two tiles ever cover the same
voxel and nothing is ever written over. A run whose tiles would overlap is
refused when the images are declared, rather than being allowed to lose data
quietly as it goes.

It is worth being plain about what is given up, because the choice is a real one.
Many microscopists deliberately acquire with ten or fifteen per cent overlap, and
the reason is that the two recordings of a shared strip can afterwards be compared
to work out where the stage *actually* put each tile, as opposed to where it
reported putting it. That comparison is how the small errors a stage makes get
corrected.

Without overlap there is no such comparison to make. A tile is written at the
position the stage reported, and if the stage was slightly off then the seam
between two tiles is slightly wrong — permanently, because nothing on disk holds
the information that would let it be put right later.

That is the accepted trade here, and it is accepted because the alternative is not
free either. Keeping overlap means taking on a debt that has to be settled
afterwards: either by acquiring in a pattern that keeps overlapping tiles out of
one another's way and joining them up later, or by running a real stitcher that
solves the alignment of every tile at once. Neither of those exists in this
project, and a half-kept overlap — recorded but never resolved — would be the
worst of both, costing storage and complication for a correction nobody ever
makes. If stage accuracy ever becomes the limiting factor for an experiment here,
the honest answer is to bring in a stitcher, not to start keeping overlap in the
hope that one appears.

What you get on screen
----------------------

The viewer opens one image per acquisition type and draws it in its proper place
on the stage, so the specimen looks like one picture — which it is. Tiles appear
inside it as they land, and nothing about the image's description changes as the
run goes, which is what lets the viewer keep up with a long acquisition.

# -- how many copies of an image a run keeps ----------------------------------
#
# Decided once, before any imaging begins, and it cannot be changed afterwards
# without declaring the image again. So it is worked out from what the run says
# about itself rather than left to a fixed number that happens to suit one size
# of experiment.


# How small the smallest copy of an image should end up, measured across the
# specimen. The viewer fetches the whole of that copy, for every colour, before it
# draws anything at all -- and it does that again at every zoom, with no
# progressive reveal, so the operator watches a blank screen until it has all
# arrived. What they wait for is the *number of pieces* it is stored in rather
# than the number of bytes: each piece costs a few milliseconds of the browser's
# own bookkeeping whatever its size, and a browser will only ask for about six at
# a time.
#
# Measured against the flat viewer on stores written here, opening a view costs
# 2 x ceil(coarsest width / piece)^2 x colours requests, which predicted every
# measurement exactly. With 256-voxel pieces that works out as:
#
#   a canvas 100,000 voxels across, 3 copies -> smallest 25,000 -> ~19,000 requests
#   the same canvas with 6 copies            -> smallest  3,125 ->     676, ~4.7 s
#   the same canvas with 8 copies            -> smallest    781 ->      64, ~0.4 s
#
# A thousand voxels is where that curve has flattened out, and it is also what
# `zmart-viewer/DATA_LAYOUT.md` asks a writer for.
#
# Halving happens in whole steps, so in practice the smallest copy lands anywhere
# between half of this figure and the figure itself. Half of it is the floor, and
# stopping there is deliberate: below about five hundred voxels a copy has ceased
# to be an overview of the specimen and become a thumbnail, and the reading it
# saves is no longer worth the writing it costs on every tile that arrives.

# shrink an image by five hundred and twelve times, which brings even a canvas

# placed where it lands on nothing; and each keeps its own list of the pieces of
# picture being written at this moment, so that two tiles are never halfway
# through the same piece at once. Neither list can see the other writer's, so two
# tiles landing in one piece are written over each other and nothing says so.
#
# The cure is for a writer to say on disk that it has these images, and for the
# next one to look. What makes the note trustworthy is that the operating system
# is asked to mark the file as held for as long as the writer keeps it open: the
# mark goes away by itself when the writer is closed, and also when its process
# ends for any reason at all, including a crash or the machine losing power. So a

    This is worked out once, when the writer is made, and it is what lets the
    writer keep two tiles out of one file later on. Two things about it were each
    found by a measurement rather than by reasoning, so they are written down here.

    **Every copy of an image is asked, not only the smallest.** A tile is written
    into all of the progressively smaller copies, so it can share a file with
    another tile in any one of them. It is tempting to collapse that into a single
    number, since a piece of the smallest copy covers the most ground — but that
    does not work, and the code used to do it. Suppose the full-size copy keeps 128
    voxels in a piece and the half-size copy keeps 100, which is 200 voxels of
    specimen. Holding tiles apart in blocks of 200 draws a boundary at voxel 200,
    and that boundary falls in the middle of the full-size copy's piece covering
    128 to 256. Two tiles either side of it are then judged to share nothing and
    write that one file at the same time. Measured here, a pair of tiles arranged
    that way lost 14336 voxels in 20 of 20 attempts. Asking each copy about its own
    pieces has no such gap in it, and it never holds tiles apart more than the
    storage actually requires.

    **A shard counts, not the chunk inside it.** Ordinarily a piece is a chunk, the
    smallest amount of picture zarr keeps as one file. But a zarr image can also be
    *sharded*, which means many chunks are bundled together into a single file to
    save the filesystem from millions of tiny ones. When that is done it is the
    bundle, not the chunk, that is read and written back whole — so two tiles in
    different chunks of one bundle are every bit as dangerous as two tiles in one
    chunk, and measuring in chunks would let them through. Measured here on zarr
    3.1.6, four tiles written at once into four chunks of one bundle left three of
    them missing, with nothing reported.

        The ``min`` and ``max`` written here are the range of numbers the camera
        can produce at all — nought to 65535 for a 16-bit camera — which is a
        plain fact about the data and always worth recording.

        The ``start`` and ``end`` are a different thing: they are the brightness
        range the image should first be *displayed* with.

        These used to be left out when a run did not ask for a window, on the
        reasoning that a viewer would then measure a good one from the pixels.
        That reasoning was sound but the file it produced was not: **a describing
        block with an incomplete window is refused outright.** Checked against
        ngio, a block naming a channel without ``start`` and ``end`` fails to
        open, while the same image with no describing block at all opens
        perfectly well. So the choice was never "a measured window or a declared
        one" — it was "a complete window or no channel names and colours at all",
        and names and colours are worth having.

        So a window is always written now. When the run did not ask for one, the
        camera's whole range is declared, because that is the honest thing to say
        when nothing is known. Be aware of what that looks like: a real
        acquisition sits in the bottom few per cent of a camera's range — a few
        hundred counts of background with the signal not far above — so an image
        opened on the whole range looks almost black until somebody drags the
        contrast slider. **A run that knows roughly how bright its images are

        Nothing here is expensive: declaring a large image writes a few hundred
        bytes of description and no picture at all. Space is taken only as tiles
        are written, so it is much better to declare comfortably more room than
        the run could possibly need than to risk running out.

        Args:
            folder: where to put the image. Created if it is not there yet.
                This is the run's own folder, and every acquisition type in the
                run writes its image into it side by side.
            name: what to call this image, which should be the acquisition type
                it holds — ``"overview"``, ``"prescan"``, ``"targetscan"``. The
                viewer groups the rows it shows by this name, so it is what the
                operator sees rather than an internal detail.
            canvas_shape: how much room to allow, as ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels.
                Across the specimen — the ``y`` and ``x`` of it — the stage's
                travel range is a good choice when the experiment does not say:
                the stage cannot reach outside it, so no tile can ever land
                beyond the edge, and over-declaring costs nothing there.

                **Depth is the exception, and it is worth a moment.** Give ``z``
                the depth the run means to image, with room to spare, rather than
                the stage's whole travel in z. The reason is that the smaller
                copies of an image shrink it across the specimen but keep every
                plane of its depth, and the viewer judges how bright an image
                should look by sampling four planes spread through that depth.
                Declare much more depth than you image and all four land in
                planes nothing was ever written to, so the volume view and the
                contrast slider open with no usable range at all — silently.
                About three times the imaged depth is the point where that starts,
                which is measured in ``zmart-viewer/DATA_LAYOUT.md``. Depth also
                needs no generosity: a run knows the stack it asked for.
            tile_shape: the size of one acquired tile, as ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels.
            tile_step: how far the stage moves between neighbouring tiles, as
                ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels. This must be at least as large as
                ``tile_shape`` along every axis, so that neighbouring tiles butt
                up rather than overlapping. A smaller step is refused, because
                everything goes into one image and the second tile of an
                overlapping pair would silently replace part of the first.
            voxel_size_um: how large one voxel is, as ``(z, y, x)`` in microns.
                This is what makes the scale bar and the measurements truthful.
            channels: the colours of light being recorded, in the order they
                appear along the channel axis.
            origin_um: where the low corner of the image sits in stage
                coordinates. Tile positions given to :meth:`write` are measured
                from the same zero, so this is usually the low end of stage travel.
            frames: how many moments to allow room for. A run that is not a
                timelapse leaves this at one. A timelapse should declare
                comfortably more than it could possibly record — ten thousand is
                a sensible figure and costs nothing, in the same way that the
                room in space is declared to the stage's whole travel range.
                Nothing is written to a moment until a frame lands in it, so an
                unrecorded moment occupies no space on disk at all, and the
                viewer shows only the moments that were actually imaged. This
                cannot be raised afterwards, so err on the generous side.
            dtype: the kind of number one voxel is. Use the camera's own — a
                16-bit camera writes ``uint16`` — because every level of the image
                must share it and converting would only lose precision.
            chunk: how large a piece of image is, in y and x. A few hundred is
                right: pieces that are too large make the viewer read far more
                than it needs whenever it wants a small sample.
            shard: how large a **bundle** of pieces is, in y and x, or left out to
                keep every piece in a file of its own. Bundling many pieces into one
                file is what OME-Zarr 0.5 calls sharding, and it keeps a long run
                from leaving millions of small files behind. It needs 0.5, since the
                older generation has no way to describe it. Only the full-size copy
                is bundled. A view built by :mod:`zmart_storage.linked` sets this
                from the tiles it points at, because the view has to be stored
                exactly as they are for their bytes to be handed over untouched.
            levels: how many progressively smaller copies to keep. These are what
                let a huge image feel light when zoomed out, and normally this is
                left out so that the writer can choose the number from
                ``canvas_shape`` — see :func:`copies_for_a_canvas`.

                It is worth knowing what that choice is for. The viewer reads the
                whole of the *smallest* copy, for every colour, before it draws
                anything at all, and it does so again at every zoom. So the number
                of copies decides how long an operator looks at a blank screen
                when they open a view. A canvas covering the stage is some fifty
                times wider than one tile, and keeping a fixed three copies of it
                left the smallest one twenty-five thousand voxels across — tens of
                thousands of pieces to fetch before the first picture appears.
                Letting the halving continue until the smallest copy is about a
                thousand voxels brings that down to a few dozen pieces, which is
                the difference between a view opening in under a second and one
                that never really opens at all.

                Give a number here if you have a reason to — matching a store
                somebody else wrote, or making a measurement — and it is used
                exactly as asked.
            discard_existing_run: whether to throw away a run that has already
                been imaged into this folder. Normally left alone, and then a
                folder that already holds acquired pictures is refused rather
                than emptied. Set it only when you know what is there and mean
                to lose it — repeating a test run into the same scratch folder
                is the usual honest reason. Only this acquisition type's image
                goes; other acquisition types in the same folder are untouched.
            ome_zarr_version: which generation of the OME-Zarr format to write,
                ``"0.4"`` or ``"0.5"``.

                ``"0.4"`` is the default because it is what almost everything can
                read today. ``"0.5"`` is the newer standard, and it is where the
                format is going — this viewer reads it fully, and being able to
                write it is what lets a live run be checked against the format the
                project is aiming at rather than only against the one it started
                with.

                Nothing an operator sees changes. The same axes are declared and a
                run written either way looks identical once it is open. What
                differs is where the store keeps its description and how the
                pieces of image are named on disk. Choose ``"0.5"`` when
                everything that will read the run understands it, and ``"0.4"``
                when you are not sure.
            keeps_its_tiles_in: the name of a subfolder inside this image that
                holds acquired tiles which must survive being declared. Normally
                left out, and then the image is treated as the only thing in its
                own folder, which is the ordinary case.

                It is set by :func:`zmart_storage.linked.link_the_tiles` when a
                view is asked to keep the positions it points at inside itself, so
                that an operator has one folder to open and one folder to copy.
                The view holds no picture of its own — every voxel lives in those
                positions — so two things have to change, and both are handled
                here. The check that refuses to write over an imaged run steps
                past that subfolder, since otherwise the positions would look
                exactly like a run about to be lost. And ``discard_existing_run``
                clears the view's description and its zoomed-out copies while
                leaving the positions untouched, because throwing the view away is
                meant to cost you a few kilobytes rather than the acquisition.
            records_coverage: whether to keep a note beside the image of where it
                has actually been imaged. Normally left alone.

                Set it to ``False`` for an image that will never have a tile
                written into it — a **view**, which holds no picture of its own and
                only says which piece of the picture is which piece of which
                position. Its record would say for ever that nothing had been
                imaged, which is worse than keeping no record at all: a reader
                bounding itself to it would show an empty screen over a run that
                imaged perfectly well. The positions are what were imaged, and they
                are what a record should be kept of.

        Returns:
            The image, ready to be written into. When the run is over it can be
            left as it is; :meth:`close` is only needed if another program is
            going to write the same run afterwards.

        Raises:
            ValueError: if the tiles would overlap, if this folder already holds
                an imaged run, or if another program is already writing this
                acquisition type. Overlapping tiles are refused because everything
                goes into one image, so the second of an overlapping pair would
                replace part of the first with nothing to say so. A folder that

            # than a rule: OME-Zarr does not say which is meant, and the question
            # has been open with the format's authors since 2022. Under the corner
            # reading the copies nest perfectly -- every level begins at exactly
            # this point, and a coarse voxel covers precisely the fine ones it was
            # built from. Under the other reading they would not, so a level would
            # have to be shifted by half of its own voxel to mean the same thing.
            #
            # Readers disagree about this second question, and some will place the
            # picture half a voxel off. That is theirs to correct, not ours: a file
            # that shifts itself to suit one reader is wrong for every other. The
