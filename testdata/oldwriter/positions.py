"""Write a run one position at a time, and let the viewer watch it fill in.

This is the smallest arrangement that gives an operator a live picture of a smart
experiment, and it holds only what is strictly necessary to do that.

What a run leaves on disk — one zarr, which is the whole acquisition::

    experiment/
      overview.ome.zarr/                open this; it is the acquisition
        zarr.json                       the picture's description, and the map
        0/ 1/ 2/ 3/                     the picture's levels: the pointed ones
                                        hold nothing, the deep ones are written
        overview_pos00000.ome.zarr/     one position, exactly as the camera saw
        overview_pos00001.ome.zarr/     it, directly inside -- no folder between

The positions sit **directly inside** the picture, with nothing between: the
container is itself the image, its numbered children are the levels, and its
named children are the positions. Each position is an ordinary OME-Zarr image
that opens on its own in napari or Fiji or anything else, and each carries the
run's name so it is worth something wherever it ends up. A position is never
named a bare number, so it can never be mistaken for a level.

A smart experiment usually has more than one kind of scan — a wide survey and
the detailed scans it led to — and each gets a picture of its own, so
``overview.ome.zarr`` and ``targetscan.ome.zarr`` sit side by side at the top,
each holding its own positions.

Why not simply give the viewer the positions
--------------------------------------------

Because it cannot hold them. The viewer draws with neuroglancer, which builds
drawing layers for every image it is given, so a run of a few thousand positions
never really opens. Handed one image it does not matter what is underneath: the
drawing rate measured flat from a hundred positions to six thousand four hundred.

And why not copy the positions into one big image, which would also give the
viewer one thing to open? Because that writes every voxel twice — once as the
position and once as the copy — and a run is large enough that the second copy is
a real cost in disk, in time, and in waiting. **No voxel of a position is written
twice here**, which is the claim that matters and the one this arrangement rests
on.

It is not quite "nothing is written". A position keeps only as many zoomed-out
copies of itself as halving allows before one would be smaller than a single piece
— see :func:`how_many_copies_a_position_can_keep` — and the picture is deeper than
that as soon as a run is wide. Every level past what a position can supply has
nothing to point at, so it is written, from the positions' own pixels. Measured on
runs of 512-voxel positions in 128-voxel pieces: levels 0 to 2 hold **no chunk
files at all**, and a run of four hundred positions writes 3.4 MB in 125 chunks of
levels 3 and 4, against 216 MB of positions. It grows with the *area* of the run
rather than with the amount of data in it, so the ratio only improves as the
positions get deeper or more numerous.

Opening a run in napari, Fiji, or anything else
-----------------------------------------------

**Point other software at ``positions``, never at the picture.** This is the one
thing about the arrangement that will surprise somebody, and it is worth reading
before it does.

Each position is an ordinary OME-Zarr image with its own zoomed-out copies and its
own place on the stage recorded inside it. Opening the ``positions`` group, or any
single position in it, gives exactly what you would expect anywhere else. Nothing
about being pointed at changes a position, and no tool needs to know this project
exists to read one.

The **picture** is a different thing and does not travel. It holds no voxels at
all: every piece of it is answered, while the viewer is open, by the viewer's own
server handing over a position's file. Read straight off the disk by anything
else, it is an image full of nothing.

And it fails in the worst way available, which is why this note is here rather
than in a footnote. It does not refuse to open, and it does not warn. It opens
perfectly — the right number of levels, the right size, the right voxel size, the
right channels — and every voxel in it is nought. Someone opening a run this way
sees a black picture and reasonably concludes their acquisition is empty::

    opened with plain zarr        levels    shape        max    mean
    the picture                   0, 1, 2   1024 x 1024      0       0
    one position                  0, 1, 2    512 x 512    3919    2500

That is the price of not copying, and it is worth being clear that it is a price
rather than an oversight. The alternative — writing the whole run a second time
into one image so that any reader could open it — is the thing this arrangement
exists to avoid, and on a real acquisition it is a second copy of a great many
gigabytes.

If a colleague needs one file they can open anywhere, the honest answer today is
to give them the positions, or to write them a stitched image on purpose. There is
no way to have a single openable picture and no second copy at the same time.

What this deliberately does not do
----------------------------------

**Overlapping positions are not handled.** Each position is placed where it says
it is, and if two of them cover the same ground the later one simply wins for the
pieces they share. Deciding that properly — which position supplies a shared piece,
and how to trim the seam — is a real piece of work with a plan of its own in
``zmart-viewer/PLAN_showing_many_stores_as_one.md``. It is not needed to watch a run
arrive, so it is not here.

**A position has to begin on a whole piece boundary.** A view hands a position's
own file to the browser untouched, so the bytes asked for have to *be* that file.
:func:`Run.write` refuses a position that does not line up rather than drawing it
a little wrong. A stage that drifts by a voxel or two will trip this, and the fix
belongs in the acquisition — see the same plan.

    """How many zoomed-out copies one position can usefully keep, counting itself.

    This is the number that decides whether the picture the viewer opens has to
    write anything at all, so it is worth understanding rather than tuning.

    A view points at a position's own zoomed-out copies instead of computing its
    own, which it may do because shrinking here keeps every second voxel rather
    than averaging four — so a voxel of a position's smaller copy is a voxel of the
    whole picture's smaller copy, and belongs to that one position and no other.

    Halving stops when a copy would be smaller than one piece, because a piece is
    the smallest thing that can be handed to the browser. A position 2048 voxels
    across kept in pieces of 128 therefore carries five copies — 2048, 1024, 512,
    256, 128 — and a view over such positions writes nothing at all at those five
    zooms. **Anything coarser than the last of them is a different matter**: it has
    no copy to point at, so it is written from the positions' pixels. Which zooms a
    picture has is decided by how wide the run is, not by the position, so a wide
    enough run always writes its coarse end however many copies a position keeps.
    That is the only thing a run writes twice, it is small, and the note at the top
    of this module gives the measurement.

    **The catch, and it is the reason a run can end up writing copies anyway.** A
    position has to begin on a multiple of the piece size times the largest shrink,
    or its copy would keep a different set of voxels from the ones the picture
    would have kept — a different picture, not a rounding difference. A position
    the same size as a piece can only ever carry one copy, whatever is asked for.

    Nothing is written here beyond a folder: the picture the viewer opens is
    declared by the first position, because what it has to say about itself is
    read out of a position rather than guessed at.

    Args:
        folder: the run's own folder. Everything the run produces goes inside it,
            so it is the one thing to copy or move afterwards.
        name: what this kind of scan is called — ``overview``, ``targetscan``. The
            operator sees it as the heading in the viewer's panel, and a smart
            experiment holding more than one kind keeps each in its own run.
        room: how large the whole picture may become, as ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels.
            This has to be decided before the run because the viewer may be reading
            the description throughout. Across the specimen, the stage's travel
            range is a good choice: the stage cannot reach outside it, and room
            that holds no position costs practically nothing on disk.
        tile_shape: how large one position is, as ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels.
        voxel_size_um: how large one voxel is, as ``(z, y, x)`` in micrometres.
        channels: the colours this run records. See
            :class:`zmart_storage.canvas.Channel`, and give each one the brightness
            window it should be shown between rather than the camera's whole range.
        origin_um: where the picture's corner sits on the stage, in micrometres.
        frames: how many moments the run will record.
        dtype: the kind of number a voxel holds.
        piece: how large a piece of the picture is, in voxels across y and x. Every
            position has to begin on a multiple of this, because the view hands a
            position's own file to the browser untouched.
        shard: how much picture to bundle into one **file**, in voxels across y
            and x, or left out to keep every piece a file of its own. Bundling
            keeps a long run from leaving hundreds of thousands of small files
            behind — the pattern filesystems, backups and endpoint protection
            all punish — while the pieces inside stay the size the viewer reads
            by, served as stretches of the file. The bundle becomes the unit a
            position must land on, so the step coarsens to a multiple of it;
            and a position is written whole, so the writer already holds every
            bundle it writes. See ``PLAN_live_smart_microscopy.md``.
        levels: how many progressively smaller copies the picture keeps, counting
            the full-size one. Normally left out, so the size of the picture
            decides — which is what keeps a large run opening quickly.
        point_at: how many of each position's own zoomed-out copies the picture
            points at rather than writes, counting the full-size one. Normally
            left out, so every copy a position keeps is pointed at — the
            cheapest arrangement, and the one that demands each position begin
            on a multiple of the piece times the deepest pointed shrink. A run
            that must place finer than that — fields of view overlapping
            wherever the specimen took them — says ``point_at=1``, which points
            at full size only, writes the zoomed-out copies instead, and asks
            only that a position begin on a whole piece. The refusal a
            misplaced position meets names this parameter; this is where to
            follow its advice.
        ome_zarr_version: which generation of OME-Zarr to write, ``"0.5"`` or
            ``"0.4"``. 0.5 is the default here because it is the current standard;
            choose 0.4 if something that will read the run cannot manage 0.5.

    Returns:
        A :class:`Run`, ready to be handed positions.
