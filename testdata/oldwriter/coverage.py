"""Where a run actually imaged, written down while it happens.

Why this exists
---------------

A run declares far more room than it is going to fill. That is deliberate, and
:mod:`zmart_storage.canvas` explains it at length: a piece of an image costs
nothing on disk until something is written into it, so a canvas can honestly
declare the stage's whole travel range and then be filled in wherever the
experiment goes. What it leaves behind, though, is a picture-frame with no note
of which parts of it hold a picture.

That gap is felt in three places, and all three are about the same missing
sentence.

The viewer draws by asking for small pieces of the image, and it asks for them
across the whole of the declared canvas — because the declaration is all it has
to go on. Measured over a sparse run, three quarters of those requests were for
room that was never imaged, and that fraction follows the size of the
*declaration* rather than the size of the acquisition. So the more generously a
run declares its room, the more of the viewer's effort goes nowhere, which is
exactly backwards from the promise that over-declaring is free.

An operator checking coverage cannot tell "we have not been there yet" from "we
went there and the specimen was dark". Both read back as zeros, because zarr
hands back the fill value for a piece nothing has written to. A viewer that makes
empty room see-through therefore also makes a genuinely dark specimen
see-through, which is a bad way to answer "did we image that region?".

And a second front end being designed needs to know which parts of its own
drawing to cut away, so that the image underneath shows through only where there
really is an image.

Ask the record, never the brightness
------------------------------------

This is what the record is *for*: it answers "was this imaged?" as a written fact,
so that nothing has to work the answer out from how bright the voxels are. That
distinction is the whole point, and it is worth being firm about, because reading
the brightness looks so nearly right that it keeps being proposed.

It is not right, and the reason is the detector. On an ordinary camera the numbers
sit on top of an electrical offset of a hundred counts or so, so a reading of
exactly nought never happens and it is tempting to treat nought as a spare value
meaning "nobody has been here". But a photon-counting detector reports the number
of photons that arrived, and at low light **nought is a perfectly ordinary
measurement**: it means none arrived during that exposure, which is exactly the
kind of reading such a detector exists to make. Somewhere in every faint specimen
there are voxels that were genuinely looked at and genuinely counted nothing.

So a test on brightness quietly turns real measurements into "never visited", and
it does so hardest in the low-light quantitative work where the answer matters
most. The same reasoning rules out the other half of the idea — having the writer
raise every nought to one so that nought could be reserved. That would fabricate a
count the instrument never recorded, and altering an operator's measurements is
the one thing a writer must never do, however small the alteration and however
convenient the guarantee.

The record has neither problem. It is written from what the run *did* rather than
from what the pixels say, so it is equally true for a bright specimen, a dark one
and an empty field of view, and not one voxel has to be touched to keep it. Where
a reader can reach the record, that is the answer to use. Where it cannot — an
image written by something else, or a run older than the record — the honest
report is "I cannot say", which is what :attr:`Coverage.recorded` is for.

What is written, and where
--------------------------

A run's folder gains one extra folder called ``zmart-coverage``, sitting beside
the images rather than inside any of them, with a folder within it named after
each image::

    run/
      overview.ome.zarr/          the pictures, untouched
      targetscan.ome.zarr/
      zmart-coverage/
        overview.ome.zarr/
          tiles.jsonl
          regions.json
        targetscan.ome.zarr/
          ...

Two files, with different jobs.

``tiles.jsonl``
    One line for every tile that was successfully written, in the order the
    tiles landed. Each line is a small block of JSON saying which acquisition
    and image the tile belongs to, where its low corner sits in voxels, how
    large it is, its place in the scan pattern if it had one, and the moment it
    landed. This is the exact record, and it is the one that survives a run
    being cut short: a line is added when a tile is safely on disk and nothing
    ever rewrites the file, so whatever reached the disk stays there.

``regions.json``
    A short summary a browser can read in a single request: the same coverage
    boiled down to a list of rectangles, together with how many tiles have been
    written, which moments and colours have been recorded, and whether the run
    has finished. Rectangles that sit against one another are joined up, so an
    ordinary raster of several hundred tiles comes back as one rectangle rather
    than several hundred.

Both files are measured in voxels of the full-resolution image, counted from the
same corner that :meth:`zmart_storage.canvas.TileCanvases.write` measures a
tile's ``origin`` from. Nothing here repeats the voxel size or the position on
the stage, because the image's own OME-Zarr description already carries those
and two copies of one number are one copy too many.

Why beside the images and not inside them
-----------------------------------------

Putting the record inside each ``.ome.zarr`` folder would have been tidier to
look at, and it was tried first. Two measurements sent it outside instead.

The first is about readers. Anything at all that is added inside an image folder
— a file or a folder, whatever it is called — makes zarr complain the moment a
program asks an image what it contains: ``Object at zmart-coverage is not
recognized as a component of a Zarr hierarchy``. The image still opens and every
picture still reads, so nothing is broken, but a viewer that has never heard of
this record should not have to explain a warning about it to its user. Outside
the images there is nothing for zarr to have an opinion about.

The second is about the viewer watching a live run. It decides whether anything
has changed by looking at when each folder was last touched, and adding a file to
a folder counts as touching it. A summary rewritten every second inside an image
folder would therefore have looked, once a second, like the acquisition itself
having changed, and the viewer would have rebuilt its whole description of the
run each time — which on a folder holding a few thousand acquisitions takes over
a second by itself. One folder deeper, the rewriting is invisible to that check.

Why the record is kept this way
-------------------------------

Several threads write tiles at the same time — that is the point of the writer —
so the record has to be safe when two of them land at once. Two shapes of
mistake were available here and both have bitten this project before.

The first is to keep one file that every tile *reads and rewrites*. That is the
same read-change-write-back pattern that loses zarr chunks when two tiles share
one, and it loses lines here for exactly the same reason: whichever writer
finishes second saves a copy of the file that never contained the other's line.

The second is to write one small file per tile, which is perfectly safe but
leaves a reader with a folder of thousands of files and no way to open them over
plain HTTP, which cannot list a folder.

So ``tiles.jsonl`` is only ever *added to*, never read back and rewritten. Each
line is handed to the operating system in one go, through a file that was opened
in "always add to the end" mode, with a lock held so that two threads cannot be
halfway through a line at once. There is nothing to lose, because nothing that is
already on disk is ever touched again.

``regions.json`` is a different matter, because a summary has to be rebuilt from
scratch each time. It is never edited where it lies. A complete new copy is
written under a temporary name and then moved into place in a single step that
the filesystem either does or does not do — so a reader arriving at any moment
sees either the whole of the old summary or the whole of the new one, and never
half of either. Rebuilding is done at most once a second while the run goes, and
once more when the run finishes, which keeps a live viewer within a second of the
truth without making every tile pay for a rewrite.

One thing this arrangement leans on, deliberately: the writer already refuses to
let two programs write one acquisition at the same time, because everything that
keeps a tile safe is remembered inside the writer rather than read back from
disk. The coverage record leans on that same guarantee and asks for nothing more.
If two programs did somehow write one run, the tiles themselves would already be
being lost, and the record would be the smaller of the two problems.

Is there somewhere in OME-NGFF this belongs?
--------------------------------------------

It was worth looking, and the honest answer is no — not yet. OME-NGFF describes
how an image is *arranged*: its axes, its progressively smaller copies, its
channels, and for plates its wells. It has nothing that says which parts of an
array have been written to, and neither does zarr itself. The nearest thing in
the wider community is the region-of-interest table that the Fractal project
keeps beside an image, but that is a convention rather than part of the standard,
it is stored in a form that needs a specialist reader, and it describes regions
chosen for *analysis* rather than the ground a run covered.

So this is written as an addition rather than as standard metadata, and it is
kept deliberately out of the way. It goes in a folder of its own with a name
nothing else uses, not one byte of any image changes, and nothing is added inside
an image folder at all. A viewer that has never heard of it opens the images
exactly as it did before.
