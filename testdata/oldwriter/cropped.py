"""Keeping the overlap and still handing the viewer one picture.

Why this exists
---------------

Microscopists usually acquire with the tiles deliberately overlapping — ten or
fifteen per cent is common. The overlap is not waste. It is the only evidence
that says where the stage *really* put each tile, as opposed to where it reported
putting it, because the strip two tiles both photographed can afterwards be
compared and the difference measured. A stitcher needs that strip; without it
there is nothing to compare and the seams stay wherever the stage happened to
leave them.

:mod:`zmart_storage.canvas` cannot accept such a run, and it is right not to. It
writes everything into one large image, an image holds a single value per voxel,
and so the second tile of an overlapping pair would quietly replace the strip it
shares with the first. That writer therefore refuses an overlapping acquisition
outright rather than losing a fifth of the acquired data with nothing to show for
it.

But the viewer really does want one image. Measured in this repository, a folder
of a thousand separate positions drew twenty-four frames in five seconds where a
hundred managed three hundred, because the drawing engine builds layers per image
and every one of them takes part in every frame. A run of ten thousand tiles
cannot be a folder of ten thousand images and still be usable.

This module is the way out of that, and the idea is simple enough to state in one
sentence: **write the acquisition twice, once whole and once trimmed.**

What gets written
-----------------

Two things sit side by side in the run's folder, and each has one job::

    run/
      overview.ome.zarr/            the canvas -- one image, trimmed, for the viewer
      overview_tiles/               the archive -- every tile whole, overlap intact
        overview_pos00000.ome.zarr
        overview_pos00001.ome.zarr
        ...
      zmart-coverage/               where the run actually imaged
        overview.ome.zarr/

**The tiles**, exactly as the camera recorded them, one small OME-Zarr per
position. Nothing is trimmed, nothing is averaged, and no voxel is written twice,
so every reading the instrument made is still on disk afterwards. This is the
archive, and it is what a stitcher is given when somebody comes to solve the
alignment properly. It is also ordinary OME-Zarr, so it opens in napari, in Fiji,
and in whatever a colleague happens to use.

**The canvas**, which is one image holding each tile with the overlapping parts
taken off. Where two tiles meet, half the shared strip comes off each of them, so
what goes in covers exactly the ground the stage stepped by. Trimmed that way,
neighbouring tiles butt up against one another and touch nowhere at all — which
means nothing is ever written over, and the existing refusal in
:func:`zmart_storage.canvas._refuse_overlapping_tiles` is satisfied without being
weakened by a single line. That refusal is not worked around here; trimming is
what makes it beside the point.

The viewer opens the canvas and nothing else, so it holds one image however many
tiles the run gathers.

How much comes off, and where
-----------------------------

Nothing about the trimming is chosen or switched on. It is worked out, axis by
axis, from two numbers the acquisition has already had to state::

    overlap on an axis = the tile's size on that axis - the stage's step on it
    what comes off each meeting edge = half of that

Three things follow from putting it that way, and each of them matters.

**A run whose tiles butt up is not a special case.** Its overlap is nought on
every axis, so nothing is trimmed, and what this writer does is exactly what
:class:`zmart_storage.canvas.TileCanvases` does on its own. There is no setting to
get wrong, which is the point: a setting can be wrong for a whole run before
anybody notices, whereas the tile size and the stage's step are facts the run
could not have started without.

**Depth is treated like anything else.** Many runs overlap across the specimen and
not at all in depth, and they get no trimming in depth. A run that also overlaps
its stacks — stepping the stage in ``z`` by less than the depth it images — is
trimmed in depth by the same arithmetic. Neither case needs saying out loud.

**Only edges that face another tile are cut.** A tile at the edge of the raster
has nothing on its far side, so there is nothing to replace what would be cut
there, and trimming it would throw away a strip of real specimen right around the
outside of the run. So an edge is trimmed only where a neighbour is going to
butt up against it, and the picture the canvas holds covers exactly the ground the
run covered — no more and no less. Whether a tile has a neighbour is read from its
place in the scan pattern, which is what ``tile_index`` says, together with how
many tiles the pattern takes, which is what ``tile_grid`` says.

Two rules the arithmetic imposes
--------------------------------

**The overlap has to be an even number of voxels** wherever it is not nought,
because half of an odd number of voxels is not a voxel. An acquisition can choose
its overlap freely, so this costs nothing to satisfy, and a run that breaks it is
refused when it is declared rather than left to lose or duplicate a row.

**A trimmed tile has to be a whole number of pieces of the canvas.** A zarr image
is stored as a grid of equal pieces, and a piece is read, changed and written back
as a unit. If a trimmed tile is not a whole number of them, the boundary between
two neighbouring tiles falls in the middle of a piece, the two tiles share that
piece, and every such piece has to be written by one tile and then re-read and
rewritten by the next. Nothing is lost — the writer notices and takes the tiles in
turn — but a run pays for it on every tile, and the arrangement stops being the
clean one it was meant to be. With 128-voxel tiles and pieces of 96, an overlap of
32 leaves a trimmed tile of 96, which is exactly one piece.

That second rule is asked only where tiles genuinely meet. An axis with no overlap
is trimmed by nothing, so there is nothing this writer has to say about it that
:class:`zmart_storage.canvas.TileCanvases` does not already say on its own; and an
axis the pattern takes only one tile along has no seam at all, so a run of a single
target is never held to it.

There is one small consequence of the two rules together that is worth knowing
about, because it shows up if you look at the canvas's declared corner. The
untrimmed outer edges of the perimeter tiles have to go somewhere, and they cannot
sit at a negative position — so the canvas begins a little before the stage's low
corner, by a whole number of pieces, leaving a blank margin around the run. That
margin is what lets the outer edges have their room while every trimmed tile still
lands exactly on a piece boundary. It is never written to, so it costs nothing on
disk, and the canvas's declared position accounts for it so the picture is still
drawn in its true place.

What this costs, said plainly
-----------------------------

It costs disk. The overlapping part of every tile is stored twice: once whole in
the archive, and once as somebody's trimmed remainder in the canvas. On a run
overlapping by an eighth that is roughly a quarter more space than writing the
tiles alone, and about twice the space of writing only the canvas. Disk is the
cheapest thing in a microscope room and lost photons are the most expensive, so
that is a trade worth making — but it is a real cost and it should be budgeted
for rather than discovered.

It also costs a little time on every tile, because two writes happen instead of
one. The archive write is the cheap half: one small store, no progressively
smaller copies to keep up to date.

And what it does *not* do is stitch. The canvas is a picture assembled from where
the stage said each tile was, with hard joins between the trimmed tiles. If the
stage was slightly off, the join is slightly off, exactly as it would be for a run
acquired without overlap. The difference — the whole point — is that the evidence
needed to correct it is still on disk, in the archive, instead of having been
thrown away at the moment of writing.

        """Declare a run, before anything has been imaged.

        The arguments are the ones :meth:`zmart_storage.canvas.TileCanvases.create`
        takes, and they mean the same things, with one difference that is the whole
        point of this class: ``tile_step`` is allowed to be **smaller** than
        ``tile_shape``. That difference is the overlap, and it is kept.

        Nothing has to be said about whether to trim, or by how much. It is worked
        out from ``tile_shape`` and ``tile_step``, axis by axis — see the module's
        opening notes — so a run whose tiles butt up is trimmed by nothing at all
        and behaves exactly as :class:`TileCanvases` does.

        Args:
            folder: the run's own folder. Created if it is not there yet.
            name: what to call this acquisition type — ``"overview"``,
                ``"prescan"``, ``"targetscan"``. The canvas is named after it and
                so is the folder of whole tiles beside it.
            canvas_shape: how much room to allow the canvas, as ``(z, y, x)`` in
                voxels, measured the way the stage measures. The stage's travel
                range across the specimen is a good choice when the experiment does
                not say, because no tile can land outside it and declaring room that
                is never written costs practically nothing on disk. Give ``z`` the
                depth the run means to image rather than the stage's whole travel in
                depth — the reason is explained at :meth:`TileCanvases.create`, and
                it has caught people out.

                A little more room than this is declared behind the scenes, so that
                the untrimmed outer edges of the tiles at the edge of the pattern
                have somewhere to sit. Nothing has to be allowed for it here.
            tile_shape: the size of one acquired tile, as ``(z, y, x)`` in voxels.
            tile_step: how far the stage moves between neighbouring tiles, the same
                way. Anything smaller than ``tile_shape`` on an axis is an overlap
                there, and the overlap must be an even number of voxels.
            voxel_size_um: how large one voxel is, as ``(z, y, x)`` in microns.
            channels: the colours of light being recorded, in the order they appear
                along the channel axis.
            tile_grid: how many tiles the scan pattern takes in each direction, as
                ``(z, y, x)``. A raster knows this before it begins, and giving it
                is what lets the writer recognise the tiles at the far edge of the
                pattern and leave their outer edges whole.

                Left out, the far edge cannot be recognised, and those outer edges
                are trimmed like any other — which loses a strip half an overlap
                wide from the far side of the picture. The tiles themselves still
                hold it, so nothing is gone from the archive, but the canvas is that
                much smaller than the ground the run covered. A run that overlaps
                and does not say is warned about it here.

                A run of scattered targets has no pattern and needs none: a tile
                written without a ``tile_index`` has no neighbours by definition and
                is never trimmed at all.
            origin_um: where the low corner of the stage travel sits, in microns.
                Tile positions given to :meth:`write` are measured from the same
                zero. The canvas records its own corner, which sits a little before
                this one, so the picture is drawn in its true place without anybody
                having to think about the margin.
            frames: how many moments to allow room for. A timelapse should declare
                comfortably more than it could record; a moment nothing was written
                to occupies no space at all.
            dtype: the kind of number one voxel is. Use the camera's own.
            chunk: how large a piece of the canvas is, across ``y`` and ``x``. This
                is the number the trimming has to line up with — see the rules at
                the top of this module — so it is worth choosing together with the
                overlap rather than separately.
            levels: how many progressively smaller copies of the canvas to keep.
                Normally left out, so that the writer works it out from how much
                room was declared.
            discard_existing_run: whether to throw away a run already imaged into
                this folder. Normally left alone, in which case a folder holding
                acquired pictures is refused rather than emptied.
            ome_zarr_version: which generation of OME-Zarr to write, ``"0.4"`` or
                ``"0.5"``. Both the canvas and the whole tiles are written in it.

        Returns:
            The writer, ready to be given tiles.

        Raises:
            ValueError: if the tiles overlap by an odd number of voxels, if a
                trimmed tile would not be a whole number of pieces of the canvas, or
                for any of the reasons :meth:`TileCanvases.create` refuses a run — a
                folder that already holds an imaged run, another program already
                writing this acquisition type, or a name that is not a plain file
