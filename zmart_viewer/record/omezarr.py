"""Making a live-written position into an image other people's software can open.

A run writes each position as a folder of numbers: a full-resolution copy in a
subfolder called ``0``, a half-size copy in ``1``, a quarter-size copy in ``2``,
and so on. Those numbers are perfectly real, and on their own they are unusable.
Nothing in them says which dimension is depth and which is time, how large a
voxel is, or where on the stage the picture was taken. Open such a folder in
napari or Fiji and you are told there is no image there — because, as far as the
format is concerned, there is not. A folder of arrays only becomes an *image*
once a small description is written over it, and this module writes that
description.

What is missing without it
--------------------------

OME-Zarr is the agreed way of saying those things. This module writes version
0.5 of it, which is the generation built on zarr version 3 and the one the rest
of this project writes by default. Four pieces are needed, and a position
written by :mod:`zmart_viewer.record.coordinator` has none of them until this module
runs:

*The image group.* The position folder itself has to be marked as a group — a
folder that holds arrays — and that mark is a small ``zarr.json`` file at its
top. Without it, ``zarr.open_group`` refuses the folder outright and no reader
gets any further.

*The version.* One line, ``ome.version``, saying which generation of the format
the description follows. A reader uses it to decide how to interpret everything
else.

*The multiscale block.* This names the axes, gives each one a type and a unit,
and lists the progressively smaller copies with what each of them means.

*The dimension names on each copy.* Version 0.5 requires every array to name its
own dimensions, and requires those names to match the axes above. It is what
lets somebody open a single zoomed-out copy on its own and still know which
dimension is depth.

What a coordinate transformation is
-----------------------------------

The phrase sounds forbidding and the idea is simple. A voxel in the file is
addressed by counting: row 40, column 512, plane 3. A place on the specimen is
measured: 14 microns up, 179.2 microns across. A **coordinate transformation** is
the recipe for turning the first into the second, and OME-Zarr writes it as two
plain lists of numbers.

The **scale** says how much ground one step along each axis covers — a voxel
0.35 microns wide and 2 microns deep. Multiply the counted position by the scale
and you have a distance, but measured from the corner of this picture rather
than from anywhere on the microscope.

The **translation** says where that corner sits in the run's shared coordinates.
Add it, and the same voxel now has a place on the stage that a neighbouring
position agrees with. This is what lets two tiles imaged an hour apart line up
when a colleague opens them together.

The order matters and the format fixes it: the scale is written first and the
translation second, because the offset is given in real distance rather than in
voxels. Written the other way round the picture lands a whole run's width away
from where it belongs.

Two further decisions, both taken to match the rest of this project rather than
invented here. The translation is written **beside each copy and nowhere else**;
OME-Zarr also allows one statement for the image as a whole, and saying it in
both places moves the picture twice as far out as it really is. And the number
is the **corner** of the first voxel rather than its middle, so that the copies
nest exactly — a coarse voxel covers precisely the fine voxels it was built
from. the voxel-placement note (formerly ``zmart_storage/VOXEL_PLACEMENT.md``) sets out the arithmetic behind that
choice, and ``docs/design/zmart-ome-zarr-recipe.md`` records both decisions.

Using it
--------

The module works on a position that has already been written. It reads nothing
of the pixels and moves none of them; it adds the small files that turn what is
already on disk into an image::

    from zmart_viewer.record.omezarr import describe_the_position

    describe_the_position(
        publisher.position_store("pos00003"),
        publisher.profile,
        name="pos00003",
        channels=("488", "561"),
        origin_pixels=publisher.layout.placement("pos00003").origin,
    )

Afterwards ``zarr.open_group`` opens the folder, ``ngff-zarr`` reads the voxel
size and the corner back, and a colleague can drag the position into napari.

    an image: the mark at the top saying this is a group of arrays, the axes and
    their units, the voxel size and corner beside each copy, and the dimension
    names inside each copy.

    Running it twice over the same position is harmless and simply writes the
    same description again, which is what you want if a run is resumed.

    Args:
        store: the position's folder, the one named ``<something>.ome.zarr``.
        profile: the sealed description of how this kind of acquisition is
            written.
        name: what to call this picture. Defaults to the folder's own name with
            the ``.ome.zarr`` ending taken off, which for a live run is the
            position's identifier.
        levels: the pyramid levels present below ``store``. By default every
            canonical level in the profile is required and described.
        channels: the colours of light the run records, as names or as prepared
            :class:`~zmart_viewer.record.model.Channel` values.
        origin_pixels: where this position's first voxel sits, counted in
            full-resolution pixels from the corner of the run. For a live run
            this is ``layout.placement(position_id).origin``. Left out, the image
            says nothing about where it sits.
        seconds_between_timepoints: how long one step along the time axis lasts.
        smaller_copies_made_by: how the zoomed-out copies were built, either
            ``"mean"`` or ``"nearest"``.
        time_unit: what the time axis is measured in.

    Returns:
        The description that was written, so a caller can log it or check it.

    Raises:
        ZmartLiveError: when the folder is not there, when a copy the profile
            promises has not been written, or when the profile cannot be
            described as an OME-Zarr image at all. Nothing is written in any of
