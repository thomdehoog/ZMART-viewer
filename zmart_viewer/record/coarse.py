"""The zoomed-out picture, and why it is the awkward part of publishing live.

Everything else in this package divides cleanly. A position owns its own pixels,
a commit makes one position visible, and no two positions tread on each other.
The zoomed-out levels are where that tidiness breaks down, and it is worth
understanding why before reading the code.

When you zoom out, one pixel on the screen stands for many pixels of specimen —
and once you are far enough out, a single stored piece of the zoomed-out picture
covers **several positions at once**. That piece is one thing. It cannot be half
published.

So imagine two neighbouring positions sharing one zoomed-out piece. The first has
finished writing; the second is still going. What should that piece contain?

Not both, plainly — the second position is unfinished, and showing it would be
exactly the wrong picture this whole design exists to prevent. But the piece
cannot simply be withheld either, because then the first position would be
invisible when zoomed out despite being complete, and an operator would watch
their run stay blank while it was in fact filling up.

The answer, and the rule this module implements
-----------------------------------------------

    **A zoomed-out piece is built from the committed positions only, and it is
    rebuilt each time another position joins it.**

So the shared piece first shows the first position and empty ground where the
second will go. When the second position commits, the piece is rebuilt to show
both, and that rebuild is published in the same single step as the position
itself. A viewer therefore sees the first position, then both — and never a
glimpse of the second before it was finished.

This is what the architecture record means by rebuilding and validating every
affected zoomed-out piece before the visible revision moves. It is also the
reason a commit is not free: the more positions share a piece, the more work each
commit does. :func:`chunks_touched_by` is what keeps that bounded, by working out
exactly which pieces a position disturbs — and, just as importantly, which it
does not.

What this module does not do
----------------------------

It does not decide *when* to publish; that is :mod:`zmart_viewer.record.manifest`. It does
not decide who owns which pixel; that is :mod:`zmart_viewer.record.ownership`. It answers
two narrow questions: which zoomed-out pieces does this position disturb, and
what should each of those pieces contain given what has been committed so far.
