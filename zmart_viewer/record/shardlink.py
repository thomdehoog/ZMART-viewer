"""Finding one small chunk inside a big bundled file, without unpacking it.

Why this exists
---------------

When a microscope writes a large image, it has a choice about how to lay the
pixels out on disk. The image is cut into *chunks* — small rectangular pieces,
perhaps 256 by 256 pixels — because a viewer that wants one corner of the
specimen should not have to read the whole plane to get it. That is good for
reading, but it is unkind to the file system: a single overnight run can easily
produce hundreds of thousands of little files, and most storage systems, backup
tools and network shares slow to a crawl long before that.

*Sharding* is the answer. A shard is one file that holds many chunks packed end
to end, with a small table at the back saying where each chunk starts and how
long it is. The file system sees a few large files; the viewer still gets its
individual chunks. Nothing about the picture changes — only the number of files.

The difficulty this module solves is what happens next. Our seamless quick-look
view does not copy pixels. It builds a *linked* view: a second, virtual image
whose chunks are not stored at all, but are described as "the same bytes that
already live over there". For that description to be writable, we have to be
able to say, for one chunk, exactly which file it lives in, at which byte, and
for how many bytes. Sharding hides that behind the packing, and this module
brings it back out.

The important thing is that nothing is decoded, recompressed or copied. We read
the little table, do some arithmetic, and hand back a byte range. The pixels stay
exactly where the acquisition put them.

What a shard file looks like inside
-----------------------------------

Laid out from the beginning of the file, a shard written by Zarr version 3 is:

* the encoded chunks, one after another, in whatever order they happened to be
  written — the order is *not* meaningful and must never be assumed;
* a table with one 16-byte entry per chunk position in the shard, each entry
  being two little-endian 8-byte numbers, the *offset* into the file and the
  *length* in bytes;
* a four-byte checksum guarding the table.

The table is normally at the end of the file, which is what lets a writer append
chunks as they arrive and only settle the table when the shard is closed. The
format also permits the table at the beginning, and both are supported here.

The table has an entry for *every* chunk position the shard could hold, whether
or not anything was written there. A position that was never written is marked
with the largest number an 8-byte field can hold, in both the offset and the
length. That is not damage; it is the ordinary way of saying "nothing here, this
region is the fill value", and it happens constantly at the edges of an image and
wherever the specimen was not imaged.

Entries are in row-major order over the chunk positions inside the shard. That
means the last axis varies fastest: for a shard holding two by two chunks, the
entries describe (0, 0), then (0, 1), then (1, 0), then (1, 1). Getting this
order wrong does not produce an error — it produces the wrong picture, quietly —
which is why it is stated here and checked by the tests.

Why the table is remembered, and how that stays safe
----------------------------------------------------

Reading the table is not free. One bundle written by the overview plan holds a
whole 1152-pixel frame across ninety-six planes, which is 7,776 chunk positions
and a table 124 kilobytes long, and every one of those entries has to be checked
before any chunk in the bundle can be pointed at. Filling one screen of the
viewer takes dozens of chunks, and nearly all of them come from the same few
bundles, so reading that same table dozens of times is most of what the viewer
was waiting for.

So a table that has been read is kept for a while. The danger in keeping anything
is obvious and it is worth saying out loud: a table that has gone out of date does
not produce an error. It produces a byte range that points somewhere real, decodes
perfectly, and shows a plausible picture of the wrong part of the specimen.

What makes it safe is that the table is remembered against the *identity of the
file it came from* — its path, together with the things about it that cannot stay
the same if it were written again: how large it is, when it last changed, and
which inode holds it. A bundle that has grown because the acquisition wrote more
chunks into it, or that has been replaced, no longer matches what was remembered,
so its table is read again. Only a file that is byte for byte the one already
looked at is answered from memory, which is what a committed bundle is: the
publication rules never rewrite one.

The memory has a limit, so that a run lasting all night cannot slowly fill it.
:data:`PLACES_REMEMBERED_AT_MOST` and :data:`BUNDLES_REMEMBERED_AT_MOST` say
what that limit is and explain how each was chosen.

What this module offers
-----------------------

:func:`describe_the_bundling`
    Reads an array's own description and reports how it is chunked and bundled,
    including the perfectly ordinary case of an array that is not sharded at all.

:func:`read_the_index`
    Parses the table out of one shard, so you can ask which chunks it holds.

:func:`where_one_chunk_lives`
    The question this module was written for: given an array and the coordinate
    of one chunk, which file, which byte, how many bytes.

:func:`how_the_array_is_stored`
    Reads an array's description once and hands back something that can answer
    that question many times without reading it again. Use this when you are
    about to ask about more than one chunk of the same array.

:func:`how_the_remembering_is_going`
    Reports how many tables were read from disk and how many were answered from
    memory, which is the honest way to tell whether the remembering is working.

:func:`forget_every_remembered_index`
    Empties the memory. Chiefly for tests, which need each one to start from the
    same place as every other.

    """Read the table of contents out of a single shard file.

    What goes in
        ``shard`` is either the shard's bytes, already in memory, or the path to
        the shard file. Giving a path is usually better: only the few hundred
        bytes of the table are read, and the rest of the file — which can be
        hundreds of megabytes — is never touched.

        ``inner_chunk`` is the shape of one chunk in pixels, and ``shard_shape``
        is the shape of the whole bundle in pixels. Both come from the array's
        own description, which :func:`describe_the_bundling` reads for you.

        ``index_location`` says whether the table sits at the ``"end"`` of the
        file, which is usual, or at the ``"start"``. ``has_checksum`` says
        whether four bytes of checksum sit alongside it.

        ``remember`` decides whether a table read from a file may be kept for the
        next time the same unchanged file is asked about. Leaving it as it is, so
        that tables are kept, is what makes the viewer quick; turning it off is
        for measuring what reading one cold really costs. It has no effect when
        the shard is handed over as bytes, since there is then no file to notice a
        change in.

    What comes back
        A :class:`ShardIndex`: one answer per chunk position in the shard, each
        being either an offset and a length, or ``None`` for a position that was
        never written.

        The same table is never handed back for a file that has changed since it
        was read. See the note at the top of this module for how that is decided,
        and why a wrong answer here would be so hard to notice.

    What can go wrong
        A :class:`~zmart_viewer.record.model.ZmartLiveError` is raised when the bundle
        shape is not a whole number of chunks, when the file is too short to
        contain the table it should have, or when the table describes a chunk
        that would run off the end of the file. That last one is the check that
        catches a shard cut short by a full disk or an interrupted copy, and it
        matters: without it a truncated file would quietly yield a byte range
        that reads as plausible-looking nonsense.

    This is the question a linked view asks, once per chunk it wants to advertise.
    The answer lets it describe that chunk as a byte range in an existing file,
    so the pixels never have to be read, decoded or copied to be shown somewhere
    else.

    What goes in
        ``array_path`` is the folder of one image array. ``chunk_coordinate``
        counts *chunks*, not pixels, from the corner of the whole image: for an
        image chunked 128 pixels at a time, the chunk covering pixel rows 256 to
        383 and columns 0 to 127 is at coordinate ``(2, 0)``.

    What comes back
        A :class:`Held` giving the file, the offset and the length — or ``None``
        when that chunk was never written. ``None`` is an ordinary answer: it
        means the region holds the array's fill value, which is what happens
        wherever the run has not imaged anything, and a linked view should simply
        not advertise a chunk there.

        For an array that is not bundled, the answer is the whole of the chunk's
        own file: offset zero, and a length equal to the file's size.

    What can go wrong
        A :class:`~zmart_viewer.record.model.ZmartLiveError` is raised when the coordinate
        names the wrong number of axes or points outside the image, and when the
        shard holding it turns out to be damaged or cut short. A chunk that is
        merely absent never raises; it comes back as ``None``.

    A note on asking many times
        This reads the array's description afresh on every call, which is right
        for asking about one chunk and wasteful for asking about a hundred. When
