"""The vocabulary the live-publication machinery shares.

Every module in :mod:`zmart_viewer.record` describes the same run, so they all have to
agree on what a *position*, an *overlap*, a *region* and a *revision* are. This
file holds those shared descriptions and nothing else. It makes no decisions and
performs no work; it is the set of words the rest of the package speaks in.

Keeping the vocabulary in one place matters more here than it usually would.
The viewer and the analysis code both look at the same run at the same time, and
the whole point of the design recorded in
``docs/design/live-position-timepoint-publication-decisions.md`` is that they see
*exactly* the same thing. If the viewer and the analysis each carried their own
idea of where a tile sits, they would eventually disagree, and a disagreement of
that kind shows up as a cell counted twice or a stripe of specimen that belongs
to nobody.

Three habits run through everything below.

**Regions are half-open.** A region that runs from 0 to 100 contains pixel 0 and
stops just before pixel 100. Two regions written this way, 0-to-100 and
100-to-200, touch without overlapping, and no pixel is claimed twice or missed.
Written the other way, with both ends included, pixel 100 would belong to both
neighbours, and in an experiment that means one nucleus counted twice.

**Records cannot be edited once made.** These objects are *frozen*: once one is
created its contents can never change. That sounds inconvenient, and it is
occasionally, but it buys the property the design depends on. When a published
result says "I used layout revision 7", revision 7 still means today what it
meant when the result was written. If layouts could be edited in place, a tile
arriving later could quietly change what an already published measurement was
supposed to mean.

**Names have to be safe to write into a path.** A position, a run, a profile and
a mosaic component all become folder names on disk, so every record below checks
its identifiers as it is built. A position called ``../../escaped`` is not an
exotic thing to worry about; it is what a mistyped position list looks like, and
written straight into a folder name it would put that position's images outside
the run entirely. :func:`check_the_name_is_safe` says what is allowed, and why.

The words themselves
--------------------

:class:`Interval` and :class:`Box`
    Where something is, along one axis and along several.

:class:`OverlapBand`
    How much neighbouring tiles are asked to overlap — a range of acceptable
    values rather than one exact number, because the exact number has to fit the
    camera and the chunk size as well.

:class:`LevelGeometry` and :class:`AcquisitionProfile`
    How one kind of acquisition is written to disk: frame size, overlap, the
    zoomed-out copies, and how the file is split up internally.

:class:`GridCell`, :class:`PositionPlacement` and :class:`MosaicComponent`
    Where each tile sits in the mosaic, and which regions of it belong to it.

:class:`SceneLayoutRevision`
    A complete, dated snapshot of the mosaic as it actually turned out.

:class:`CommitEvent`
    The single record that makes a finished position or timepoint visible.

class LevelGeometry:
    """One rung of the zoomed-out ladder, and how it is stored.

    Microscopy images are kept at several magnifications at once — the full
    resolution, then half, then a quarter, and so on — so that zooming out does
    not mean reading every pixel of a very large image. Each of those rungs is a
    *level*, and level 0 is the full-resolution one.

    Three things about a level matter to this package.

    ``inner_chunk`` is the smallest piece the file can be read in. It is the unit
    the viewer asks for, and it is what a seam has to line up with if the viewer
    is to show a tile's pixels without anyone copying them first.

    ``shard`` is how many of those pieces are bundled into a single file on disk.
    Bundling exists purely to keep the number of files manageable; it changes
    nothing about where seams can fall.

    ``linkable`` says whether the seamless view may point straight at this
    level's chunks. A level can only be pointed at when its complete frame,
    overlap and grid step all contain whole chunks at that magnification. This
    deliberately rules out short terminal chunks: both the seamless and raw
    views must be able to return an existing encoded position chunk unchanged.

class AcquisitionProfile:
    """Everything about how one kind of acquisition is written, settled in advance.

    A microscope facility does not have one storage layout; it has several. An
    overview sweep, a detailed target scan, a light-sheet stack and a confocal
    series all produce differently shaped data and are best written differently.
    A profile is the answer for one of those kinds, and it is agreed *before* the
    run starts and never changed while the run is going.

    That last part is the important one. Once data has been published under a
    profile, changing the profile would mean the pixels already on disk no longer
    mean what their description says. So a profile is sealed: if the acquisition
    genuinely needs a different frame size or a different chunking partway
    through, that starts a new acquisition instance with its own profile rather
    than quietly reinterpreting what came before.

    ``analysis_halo`` is how much specimen, in pixels, a model wants to see
    beyond the region it is being asked to judge. It comes from the analysis, not
    from the viewer, which is why it is recorded here rather than assumed.

    ``channels`` names the colours the acquisition records. It belongs here
    rather than being left to the commit records because two acquisitions that
    image different colours are genuinely different acquisitions, and a profile
    that did not mention them could not tell the two apart.

    ``timepoints`` is the room along time — how many moments this acquisition
    may record, declared as a generous ceiling (stopping early is ordinary and
    costs nothing; absence expresses the unimaged tail). It lives here for the
    same reason the channels do: a timelapse is a different acquisition from a
    snapshot, and a viewer that cannot serve time yet must be able to see that
    and refuse before a single position has landed. One moment is the default,
    and a one-moment profile writes no field at all, so every profile sealed
    before this room existed keeps its stored form and its fingerprint.

        plain fact about the data and always worth recording.

        The ``start`` and ``end`` are a different thing: they are the brightness
        range the image should first be *displayed* with.

        These used to be left out when a run did not ask for a window, on the
        reasoning that a viewer would then measure a good one from the pixels.
        That reasoning was sound but the file it produced was not: **a describing

        and names and colours are worth having.

        hundred counts of background with the signal not far above — so an image
        opened on the whole range looks almost black until somebody drags the
