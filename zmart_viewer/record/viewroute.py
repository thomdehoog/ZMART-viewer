"""Serving one small piece of the linked view straight out of a bundled position.

Why this exists
---------------

The linked view is the picture an operator actually looks at: one continuous
image of the whole slide, made out of the positions the microscope has already
written. Positions are routed **whole**, overlap intact, and where two of them
cover the same ground the one that arrived later is drawn — exactly as tiles
laid on top of one another would look. Nothing of it at full resolution is
stored a second time. When the viewer asks for a piece of it, something has to
say which file already holds those exact bytes, where in that file they start,
and how many of them there are.

:mod:`zmart_viewer.record.shardlink` can answer that question for a single chunk of a
single position, and it has been proven against real files. What was missing was
the step in front of it: turning *"the viewer wants piece (0, 0, 3, 8, 8) of the
view"* into *"that is chunk (0, 0, 3, 8, 0) of the position in this folder"*, and
then into a byte range. This module is that step.

The one number everything turns on
----------------------------------

A position written by :func:`zmart_viewer.record.profiles.plan_the_writing` keeps its
pixels in two nested sizes, and telling them apart is the whole of this module.

* The **chunk** is the small piece the picture is really cut into — 128 pixels
  square in the usual overview plan. It is the smallest amount of image that can
  be decoded on its own.
* The **bundle**, which the Zarr documents call a *shard*, is one file holding
  many of those chunks end to end, with a small table at the back saying where
  each of them begins. Bundling exists for one reason only: without it an
  overnight run leaves millions of tiny files behind, and most disks, network
  shares and backup programs cope with that badly.

The older linked view in the elder linked writer (``testdata/oldwriter/linked.py``) hands the viewer **whole
files**, so for a bundled position it measures everything in whole bundles: a
position had to land on a bundle boundary, and the trimmed strip at a seam had to
be a whole number of bundles. That is a much harsher rule than it sounds, and it
is the rule that turns the sensible plan the profile chooses into a refusal. The
overview plan makes a bundle span the entire 1152-pixel frame, so a seam that
falls at 1024 pixels — which is exactly where one-sided ownership puts it — is
not on a bundle boundary at all, even though it sits neatly on the eighth chunk.

This module measures in **chunks** instead, because it hands over a byte range
rather than a file. A seam is then allowed to fall wherever a chunk boundary
falls, and it is perfectly ordinary for it to cut across the middle of a bundle:
the bundle is a container, not a picture, and taking one chunk out of the middle
of it costs a seek and a read.

Why the view itself keeps no bundles
------------------------------------

It is natural to expect the view to be stored exactly like the positions it
points at, bundles and all, and that is what the whole-file arrangement had to
do. Here it would be wrong. What is handed over is one *encoded chunk*, so the
view has to describe itself as an unbundled image whose chunk is the position's
inner chunk and whose compression is the compression applied inside the bundle.
A view that declared bundles while being served single chunks would describe its
own bytes incorrectly, and the viewer would draw noise without reporting
anything.

There is no cost to this. The reason for bundling is the number of files a run
leaves behind, and the view leaves behind no picture files at all — every piece
of it is answered by pointing at a position. So the question of how large the
view's bundles should be simply does not arise.

That is also the honest answer to a limitation recorded in the review of this
branch: :meth:`zmart_storage.canvas.TileCanvases.create` accepts a single number
for the bundle across ``y`` and ``x``, and cannot express the profile's bundle,
which is a slab of ``z`` planes spanning the whole frame. It was left alone
rather than extended, because on this route the view is never bundled and the
positions are written by the acquisition rather than by that writer. Extending it
would have added a setting that nothing on this path uses. If a future writer
does need to write a bundled *view*, that is the place to change, and this note
is here so the next person does not have to rediscover why it was not changed
now.

What this module offers
-----------------------

:func:`route_the_view`
    Reads the positions, checks that they agree with one another and that each
    lands on whole chunks, and returns a :class:`ViewRoute`.

:meth:`ViewRoute.where_this_chunk_is`
    The question the viewer's server asks: given one chunk coordinate of the
    view, which file, which byte, how many bytes — or nothing at all, when that
    part of the slide has not been imaged yet.

:func:`the_bytes_of`
    Reads exactly that range, so the bytes can be handed on undecoded.

:func:`refuse_a_view_stored_differently`
    Compares what the view says about itself with what the positions really
    contain, and refuses the pair rather than letting a viewer draw noise.

class ViewRoute:
    """Which position answers for each piece of the view, and where its bytes are.

    Build one with :func:`route_the_view` rather than directly, so that the
    positions are read and checked first.

    A route holds the positions themselves rather than one entry per piece of the
    view, and this is worth knowing before anybody tries to make it simpler. A
    position 1152 pixels across in chunks of 128 is nine by nine chunks; multiply
    that by its planes, its colours and its moments, then by the ten thousand
    positions a long run reaches, and a list with one entry per piece is tens of
    gigabytes held in memory to describe a picture that was never written. The
    viewer's own reader, in ``zmart-viewer/app/server/linking.py``, sets the same
    reasoning out at greater length and arrived at the same arrangement.

    So each position is remembered once, and the only thing spread out is a note
    of which **rows** of the view's chunk grid it reaches into. Finding a piece
    then means looking in one row and checking the few positions there.

    What each position *does* keep is its own description — how it is chunked, how
    it is bundled, what it calls its files. None of that can change while a run is
    going, since an array settles it before any pixels are written, so reading it
    again for every piece would be pure waste.

    A position's table of contents is looked after in
    :mod:`zmart_viewer.record.shardlink` rather than here, and it is worth knowing how,
    because an earlier version of this class deliberately refused to keep one. The
    worry then was a live run: chunks are still landing in a bundle while the
    viewer is watching, and a table kept from an hour ago would go on saying
    "nothing was ever written there" long after something was, so an operator would
    watch a position stop filling in halfway and never recover. That worry was
    right, and it is answered rather than ignored. A table is kept against the
    identity of the file it was read from — its size, when it last changed, and
    which inode holds it — so a bundle the acquisition has written into is no
    longer the file that was remembered and its table is read afresh. A bundle that
    has not been touched since is byte for byte the one already read, and answering
    from memory cannot be wrong. That is what turns dozens of full table reads per
    screenful into one.
