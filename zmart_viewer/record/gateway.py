"""Manifest-aware serving for live positions and the one virtual linked view.

The files under a live run are deliberately written before the atomic publication
record moves.  A plain static-file server therefore cannot distinguish a finished
chunk from one that is merely present on disk.  This module is the small boundary
between the viewer server and those files: metadata is always readable, while
pixel requests are attributed to one position and moment and are served only when
the run manifest says that exact unit is published.

For the linked view it also completes the zero-copy route.  A view chunk is
answered by an encoded inner chunk inside a canonical position's shard, using
:mod:`zmart_viewer.record.viewroute`; no pixel is decoded or copied.  Where positions
overlap, the route's claims are walked newest first and the newest **published**
claim answers — so a position that is written and routed but not yet committed
neither appears early nor blanks the published ground it is about to take over.
