"""Choose a strict, zero-copy storage plan for one acquisition type.

The camera frame, useful overlap, viewer request grid and filesystem behaviour
pull in different directions. This module searches those choices before a run
starts and seals the answer in an acquisition profile.

For every tiled axis and every power-of-two pyramid level, a valid plan requires
the frame, overlap and therefore the stage step to contain a whole number of
logical chunks. Equivalently, the chunk is a divisor of ``gcd(frame, overlap)``
at that level. This is stricter than merely allowing a short edge chunk: it is
what lets both views return an existing encoded position chunk byte-for-byte,
including the outermost row and column, without manufacturing view pixels.

Chunks may change between pyramid levels and between ``y`` and ``x``. That is
packaging, not resolution: image resolution still halves exactly at every level.
Shards then bundle many independently encoded chunks into a small number of
files. Sharding controls file count; it neither changes the seam arithmetic nor
allows half a chunk to be linked.

The optimizer returns a recommendation and its Pareto alternatives so an
operator can see an honest trade-off instead of a hidden fallback. If no strict
plan exists inside the acquisition's overlap band, planning stops with concrete
remedies. It never silently materializes pixels in ``views/``.

    Give it the kind of acquisition and the shape the instrument produces, and it

    chose so that the reasoning can be shown to whoever is running the microscope.

    ``frame`` is one number for a square frame, or a height and a width for an
    instrument whose frame is a rectangle.

    ``z_planes`` and ``channels`` do not affect where seams fall or which zoom
    levels can be pointed at. They are recorded because they are part of what
    makes this acquisition the acquisition it is, and the depth is also what
    sizes the file bundles. ``timepoints`` is the room along time, declared as
    a generous ceiling — how many moments the run MAY record; stopping early
    is ordinary. One is the default, and means a snapshot rather than a
    timelapse.

    The profile's name is worked out from everything the profile says, so two
    acquisitions that differ anywhere — in pixel type, in depth, in colours, in
    voxel size — can never end up sharing one. ``readable_prefix`` lets a run
    choose the human-readable beginning of that name; the fingerprint is appended
    either way, so choosing a prefix cannot cause a clash.
