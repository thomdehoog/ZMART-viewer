"""Write canonical positions and publish the one strictly virtual linked view.

The manifest refuses an event whose readiness is not proved from the bytes on
disk. A caller cannot supply readiness flags: this coordinator writes a complete
position or timepoint, reads every promised canonical pyramid level back, follows
the stored routes, validates the view description and the realized layout, and
only then advances the atomic publication record.

All pixels live below ``positions/``. Every canonical pyramid level is sharded
and independently portable as part of its position OME-Zarr image, and each
position's own description places it on the specimen — the store opens in the
right place in any OME-Zarr reader on its own, exactly like a mesoSPIM
transfer. The single run-wide presentation below ``views/`` is a description
and routes only. Positions enter it **whole, overlap intact**, in the order
they were committed, and where two of them cover the same ground the later
commit is drawn on top — the settled model of
``docs/design/positions-in-a-container.md``. Nothing hides the overlap: both
recordings of shared ground stay whole in the position stores, which are the
system of record.

The view may not contain a ``c/`` payload tree. Each advertised view chunk is an
already-encoded canonical inner chunk located by byte range inside a source
shard. Publication fails closed if the acquisition profile, route geometry,
encoding, draw order, or manifest generation disagrees.

Published canonical bytes are immutable. Replacing a moment creates a new
position generation, refreshes the generation-specific routes and metadata, and
publishes that answer as a new revision. A failed replacement restores the old
route map; there are no shared view pixels to roll back.
