"""The record that decides what a viewer is allowed to see.

While a microscope is running, files appear on disk continuously — half a
position, three of five colours, a zoomed-out copy that is still being built.
None of that should reach the screen. A picture assembled from a position that
is only partly written is not a slow picture; it is a wrong one, and it looks
exactly like a right one.

So this package keeps a separate record of what is *finished*, and the viewer
reads that record rather than looking at the folder. The rule is short:

    **Data becomes visible only after the complete position, or the complete
    moment, has been committed.**

Files existing means nothing. This record means everything.

How the record is arranged
--------------------------

Two files sit beside the run.

``events.jsonl`` is the active history: one line per publication and append-only
during normal operation. Recovery is the sole exception; it preserves a crash
tail in ``interrupted.json`` before removing those never-published lines. The
history says what was published, when, which storage plan and which layout it
used, and that every prerequisite was checked first.

``signed.json`` is the truth: a single small file naming the highest revision
that is completely safe to read. It is replaced by writing a new one alongside
and renaming it over the old, which the operating system does in one step — so a
reader either sees the whole previous version or the whole new one, and never a
half-written mixture.

Why both? Because a line being present in the history is not proof it was
finished; a program can die halfway through writing one. The rename is the
moment of publication, and nothing before it counts.

The counter is the truth; the announcement is a hurry-up
--------------------------------------------------------

Every publication moves a number, and that number only ever goes up. A viewer
that has drawn revision 7 and sees revision 9 knows it has fallen behind, and
knows it without having to have been listening at the right moment.

The backend may also *tell* the viewer that something changed, over whatever live
connection is already open. That message is a convenience and not the record. If
it arrives, the viewer refreshes at once; if it is lost, the next question the
viewer asks reveals the higher number anyway. A lost message therefore delays a
refresh but can never leave a viewer permanently showing something stale.

Reading it cheaply
------------------

The viewer asks "has anything changed?" many times a second, so answering must
not mean reading the history. :meth:`RunManifest.fingerprint` answers from a
single glance at the small file — no contents read at all — and only when that
glance changes is anything parsed. Even then only the new lines are read, from
where the last read stopped.
