"""A run's images described as one scene, and compiled into what the viewer draws.

A smart-microscopy run is not one picture. It is a few hundred positions, the
one linked overview built over them, and — later — whatever a stitcher or an
analysis produced from those. All of them describe the same specimen, and the
only thing that lets a viewer put them on top of one another correctly is a
written statement of where each one sits in one shared set of coordinates.

That statement is a **scene**. The word comes from OME-Zarr, which is adopting it
in version 0.6: a group above several images declaring how they sit together,
rather than one enormous rectangular array that every tile has to be forced into.
The closing section of
``docs/design/live-position-timepoint-publication-decisions.md`` explains why the
idea is worth adopting now while the file format for it is not: the released
specification is still 0.5, our analysis library cannot read 0.6 at all, and
Neuroglancer's reader has never heard of scenes. So the semantics live here, in
Python, shaped so that writing them out as 0.6 metadata later is a translation
rather than a rewrite.

The rule this module exists to protect
--------------------------------------

**Never hand the drawing engine one source per position.**

This is not a style preference. Neuroglancer builds a drawing layer for every
source it is given, and every one of those layers takes part in every frame,
whether or not anything of it is on screen. That cost is paid forever, sixty
times a second, for as long as the viewer is open. It was measured on this
project's own harness: a thousand positions handed over separately drew
twenty-four frames in five seconds, where one linked image over the same files
managed 255. The like-for-like table in
``docs/design/zmart-ome-zarr-recipe.md`` shows the same thing from the other
side — at six hundred positions, 1,547 metadata requests before the first pixel
against 120, and a worst frame of 733 milliseconds against 17.

So the scene may hold five thousand position images, because that is the truth
about the experiment. What it compiles to is **one source per view** — one for
the linked overview, one for each derived product — and never one per position.
The positions are what those views are made of; they are not separate things to
draw.

The other rule, which looks smaller and is not
---------------------------------------------

**The revision goes in a field beside the source, never inside its address.**

It is tempting to make each commit produce a new URL — ``.../overview.zarr?rev=7``
— because that certainly defeats any stale cache. It is also ruinous. A drawing
engine treats a changed address as a brand new data source; it builds a new layer
for it and has no reason to ever let the old one go. A hundred positions over a
hundred commits is ten thousand layers, and the viewer dies of exactly the cost
described above, only slowly enough that it looks like a memory leak rather than
a design mistake.

The address of a store is therefore stable for the whole run. The revision
travels beside it, as a field the frontend compares against what it last drew, so
that it can refresh the one source that actually changed and leave everything
else — the camera, the contrast, the annotations, the other open datasets —
exactly where the operator left them.

One overview, and where the raw evidence lives
----------------------------------------------

A run has **one** overview: the linked view, which routes every position whole
— overlap intact — and draws a later arrival over an earlier one wherever the
two cover the same ground. There is no second presentation hiding or selecting
the overlap, because the raw evidence needs no view of its own: both
recordings of shared ground stay whole in the position stores, which any
OME-Zarr tool opens directly.

The role an image plays is still part of its identity, from the scene all the
way through to the compiled layer name, so that a derived product — a
stitched volume, a segmentation — can never quietly fold into the overview's
layer and share its contrast control.

What is in this file
--------------------

:class:`CoordinateSystem`
    The run's shared coordinates: which axes there are and what their units mean.

:class:`AffinePlacement`
    Where one image sits and how it is scaled. An *affine transform* is simply the
    recipe for that: multiply each pixel coordinate by a scale to turn pixels into
    micrometres, then add an offset to move the image to its place.

:class:`SceneImage` and :class:`Scene`
    One image and its placement, and the whole related set of them.

:func:`build_the_scene`
    Builds that set from a sealed acquisition profile and a layout snapshot.

:func:`compile_for_neuroglancer`
    Turns the scene into the sources, layers and transforms the viewer consumes,
    with each source carrying the revision it was compiled against.
