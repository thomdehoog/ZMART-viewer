"""Deciding which tile's measurements count, and whether the grid holds together.

When a mosaic is imaged, neighbouring tiles deliberately share a strip of
specimen. That overlap is not waste: a stitcher needs it later as evidence of
where the stage really went, and a model looking at an object near a tile's edge
needs it as context.

The **picture** needs no ownership rule any more. Positions are routed whole
into the one linked view, overlap intact, and where two of them cover the same
ground the one committed later is simply drawn on top — the settled model of
``docs/design/positions-in-a-container.md``. What still has to be answered
exactly once, and answered the same way by everybody, is the **analysis**
question:

**If two tiles both photographed the same piece of specimen, which one counts?**

Get it wrong in one direction and a nucleus sitting in the overlap is counted
twice. Get it wrong in the other and a stripe of specimen belongs to nobody and
quietly disappears from the results. Neither shows up as an error; both show up
as a number that is simply wrong.

This module answers that question, in advance, from the grid alone. The
boundary is placed in the middle of the overlap wherever a neighbour exists, so
that a model judging an object near the line has specimen on both sides of it —
and the model is still *given* the whole tile, overlap included, because the
overlap is the context that lets it judge an object sitting near the edge.
