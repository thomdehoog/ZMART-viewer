"""Small live runs to test against, for anything that reads what we publish.

These four were written inside `zmart_viewer.record`'s own tests and grew a second set
of users: the viewer's gates, which need a *real* live run to open, watch and
measure. That worked while both lived in one repository and stops working the
moment they do not -- "install their test suite to run mine" is not a
dependency anyone should be asked to take.

So they live here, beside the code they exercise rather than beside the tests
that first needed them. Both sides import the same builder, which is the point:
a viewer testing against its own idea of a run would drift from what the
publisher actually writes, and the drift would be invisible until a real
acquisition found it.

Nothing here is a test. It is the smallest honest run: one overview profile,
one z plane, two positions, and pixels of a single value so a measurement can
say plainly what it saw.
