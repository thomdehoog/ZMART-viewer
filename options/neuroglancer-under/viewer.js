/**
 * Option A: neuroglancer draws the acquisition in a canvas of its own, and the
 * operator's drawing sits exactly on top of it with holes cut where the picture
 * should show.
 *
 * This file is the only place in the whole application that knows neuroglancer
 * exists. Everything around it — the page, the two gestures in `../gestures.js`,
 * the carrier outline, the tile rectangles, the measurements — is written
 * against the small interface in
 * `../contract.md` and would work just as well with a different engine
 * underneath. That is deliberate, and it is worth saying why it is worth the
 * trouble.
 *
 * Every import below comes from a folder the neuroglancer package itself calls
 * `unstable`, which is its way of saying "these are our insides and we may move
 * them". Scattered across an application, that promise is frightening: an
 * upgrade moves one file and a dozen places stop compiling, in a dozen different
 * ways, none of which mention neuroglancer. Gathered into one module it is
 * merely a chore: the upgrade breaks this file and the test that exercises it,
 * both of which are about neuroglancer and nothing else, and the rest of the
 * application does not notice.
 *
 * **So please do not import anything from `neuroglancer/unstable/...` anywhere
 * but here.** There is a check that nobody has:
 * `test_the_engine_stays_behind_its_adapter`, in
 * `viz_studio/tests/test_the_options_hold_together.py`.
 *
 * ## What this file does differently from `frontend/src/engine.js`
 *
 * Six things, and each one is fixing something that made the older integration
 * awkward rather than being a matter of taste.
 *
 * 1. **Nothing lives in a module variable.** The older engine module keeps the
 *    addresses it has handed over, the counts it has seen and the queue of
 *    stores still to feed in variables belonging to the file itself, which means
 *    a page can hold exactly one viewer. Here every one of those lives on the
 *    instance, so two viewers can sit side by side — an overview and a detail
 *    scan, or the same run before and after a change — and neither disturbs the
 *    other. It also makes closing one genuinely close it.
 *
 * 2. **Addresses are passed in, never worked out.** The older scene builder puts
 *    `window.location.origin` in front of every store's address. That is right
 *    almost always and wrong exactly when it matters: served from somewhere
 *    else, or measured against a server on a port chosen at run time, it
 *    silently reads from the wrong place. Here the caller says where the data
 *    is, and an address without a scheme is refused outright rather than
 *    quietly never fetched — which is what neuroglancer does with one, with no
 *    error and no request. That was measured on the sandwich probe, whose
 *    write-up is `viz_studio/SANDWICH.md` — a file that is not on this
 *    branch; it lives on `claude/sandwich-probe`, commit `1277e30`, in its
 *    last section.
 *
 * 3. **The operator's drawing is repainted only from inside the engine's
 *    end-of-frame announcement**, using the view read at that instant. This is
 *    the whole discipline that makes the arrangement work: measured, it holds
 *    the two layers together to one screen pixel, where repainting as the mouse
 *    moves lets them drift by twenty-five. It is built in here rather than left
 *    to the page, so a page cannot get it wrong.
 *
 * 4. **Bindings, background colour and layout are each set in exactly one
 *    place**, at the bottom of `start`. The engine's own gesture table is
 *    emptied on purpose: in this arrangement the operator's canvas lies over the
 *    engine and catches every gesture, so the engine's defaults — the plain
 *    wheel stepping through the stack, four different ways to rotate — can never
 *    fire. `CONTROLS.md` explains why each of those had to go.
 *
 * 5. **The picture stays on screen while new tiles are being fetched.** Told
 *    that a tile may have landed, the engine on its own throws away everything
 *    it has already decoded, so the window goes empty and fills back in — every
 *    few seconds, all through a run. That is fixed here, and the section
 *    "Going back to the store for what has arrived since" explains both the
 *    fault and what the engine does and does not give us to fix it with.
 *
 * 6. **The picture is placed where the store says it is.** Our writer says where
 *    an image sits by giving the corner of its first voxel; the engine reads the
 *    same description as giving the middle of it, and so drew every acquisition
 *    half a voxel early — about half a screen pixel at an ordinary
 *    magnification, and four screen pixels when zoomed in to eight times full
 *    resolution. `countFromTheCornerOfTheVoxelRatherThanItsMiddle` puts that
 *    right, and says plainly what part of it a viewer cannot put right.
 *
 * ## The bottom layer, and why this option says no to it
 *
 * `viz_studio/THE_CANVAS.md` describes a canvas of three layers sharing one
 * coordinate system: the application's own drawing beneath the picture, the
 * picture in the middle, and the operator's marks above. The interface offers a
 * slot for each — `drawUnder(paint)` and `drawOver(paint)` — and this option
 * implements both, in the sense that a drawing handed to `drawUnder` really is
 * painted on a surface placed behind the engine's canvas.
 *
 * **An operator will not see it, and this option says so plainly rather than
 * pretending.** `viewer.drawsUnder` is `false` here. Neuroglancer forces the
 * whole of its canvas opaque at the end of every frame, so a surface behind it is
 * never seen at all: measured, with one colour painted behind the engine and
 * another set as the engine's own background, an operator saw 0% of the colour
 * behind and 97% of the engine's background over ground nobody had imaged.
 *
 * The tempting thing to do instead would be to draw the bottom layer *above* the
 * engine with holes cut in it wherever the run has imaged, so that the page looks
 * the same as it does under an engine that can honour the slot. That is not done,
 * and the reason is worth stating: two options that looked identical while doing
 * entirely different things underneath would make the comparison a lie, and a
 * silent difference of exactly that kind is what this whole exercise exists to
 * avoid. An application that needs something beneath the picture on this engine
 * has a different route — put it *inside* the engine as an image or label layer,
 * which does work and is written up in `viz_studio/THE_CANVAS.md`, along with
 * what it costs.

 * Tell the engine at once that its drawing area has changed size.
 *
 * This is the one place that reaches past the engine's own arrangements, and it
 * earns its place, so it is worth explaining what it does and what happens
 * without it.
 *
 * The engine only re-reads how large it is when it notices a resize, and it
 * notices through the browser's own resize watcher — which reports *after* the
 * page has been laid out, and therefore after the engine has already drawn at
 * least one more frame at the old size. That one frame is drawn at one size and
 * stretched to fill another, so the picture in it is very slightly the wrong
 * scale and in the wrong place. Measured, that showed up as the two layers
 * coming apart by seventy screen pixels while the view was panned — not because
 * the operator's drawing was following the wrong thing, but because the engine's
 * own frame did not yet know how big it was.
 *
 * Nudging the engine's own count of resizes makes it re-read its size at the
 * start of the very next frame, before it draws anything, so the frame the
 * operator sees is drawn at the size it is displayed at. Asking for a redraw is
 * what makes that next frame happen at once rather than whenever something else
 * causes one. With this, the same measurement comes back to a single pixel.
 *
 * Both halves earn their place, and which fault each one prevents was measured
 * rather than assumed. With the whole of this taken out, the two layers came
 * apart by 69 screen pixels while panning and 71 while thrown about. With only
 * the count left out and the redraw kept, panning came back to 1 and zooming
 * stayed at 2 rather than 1 — so the redraw is what saves panning and the count
 * is what saves zooming.
 *
 * It reaches into a field rather than calling something, because there is
 * nothing to call. If a later version of the engine renames it, this file is
 * where it breaks, and the registration measurement is what says so.

/**
 * Put the picture where the store says it is, rather than half a voxel before it.
 *
 * An image has to say where in the specimen its first voxel sits, and there are
 * two ways of saying it. The writer in this project gives the **corner** of that
 * voxel: an image of one-micrometre voxels beginning at nought has its first
 * voxel covering the ground from 0 µm to 1 µm, and the coverage record beside it
 * counts the same way. The description the writer leaves in the store is read by
 * neuroglancer under the other convention, in which the number given is the
 * **middle** of the first voxel — so the engine places the whole image half a
 * voxel earlier than the writer meant. That is not carelessness on the engine's
 * part. The file format's own text says middles, and our writer says corners
 * without ever writing it down, so each is being reasonable about a description
 * that does not say.
 *
 * Half a voxel sounds like nothing, and at the magnification the engine chooses
 * for itself it very nearly is: it comes to about half a screen pixel, because
 * the engine picks whichever stored resolution puts roughly one voxel in one
 * pixel. Zoom in past the finest resolution, though, and half a voxel keeps its
 * size in the specimen while a screen pixel shrinks. Measured on this page at
 * eight times full resolution, the edge of the picture sat four screen pixels
 * away from where the operator's drawing put it — which is exactly the moment an
 * operator is asking whether a tile's picture really landed inside the square
 * they laid out.
 *
 * So the layer is moved back by half a voxel, and two things make that a
 * conversion between two stated conventions rather than a fudge. It is half a
 * voxel *of the image*, not a number of screen pixels tuned on one machine, so
 * it holds at every magnification and on a screen of any density. And it is
 * applied only where the engine has said, in `voxelCenterAtIntegerCoordinates`,
 * that it is counting from the middle of a voxel; an image it has read the other
 * way round is left exactly as it is, which also means running this twice can do
 * no harm.
 *
 * Only the two axes drawn on the window are moved. Depth and time choose which
 * plane and which moment an operator is looking at rather than where anything is
 * drawn, and shifting those by half a step would change which plane `setPlane`
 * hands back without lining anything up.
 *
 * **What this does not cure.** The engine takes its half a voxel off every
 * stored resolution separately, so a coarse level of the pyramid is placed half
 * of *its own* voxel early — one and a half micrometres for a four-micrometre
 * level built from one-micrometre data. Only the finest level can be corrected
 * from here: the coarser ones are placed once, while the description is being
 * read, and are out of reach afterwards. So a view zoomed a long way out is
 * still up to half a screen pixel out, and a view zoomed in is exact. The
 * complete cure is for the writer to say which convention it means, by giving
 * each resolution in `zmart_storage/canvas.py` a translation of half its own
 * voxel; that would also line the resolutions up with one another, which they
 * are not today.

 * Most of a canvas is usually empty — the room is declared to the reach of the
 * stage and filled in as the run goes — so a row drawn opaque everywhere blacks
 * out every row below it. That means the transparency answers one question only:
 * was this spot imaged at all?
 *
 * Getting these the other way round is a real mistake with a confusing symptom.
 * For the bottom-most picture on screen the engine switches blending off
 * altogether and writes the colour straight out, using the transparency only as
 * a yes-or-no test — so brightness put into the transparency simply never
 * arrives, and every contrast window draws the same flat shape.
 *

// because nothing on disk announces a new tile — see `tilesMayHaveLanded` below
// for why. Left to itself, the engine handles that by throwing away every piece
// of picture it had already decoded and starting again from nothing, so the
// window went completely empty for about a sixth of a second and then filled
// back in. Measured: the share of the window holding picture read
// 0.2726 → 0.0000 → 0.1839 across a single refresh. On a real acquisition that
// is a flash of empty screen every few seconds, at exactly the moment the
// operator is watching most closely, and it reads as the viewer breaking rather
// than as the viewer working.
//
// **What the engine does and does not offer.** The only instruction the engine's
// background worker accepts on this subject is "let go of everything you decoded
// from this source", and a source here is one whole resolution level of one
// acquisition — there is nothing finer. So the newly imaged ground cannot be
// singled out: the refetching really is all-or-nothing, and that part is not
// ours to change.
//
// What *is* ours to change is the picture on screen while the refetching
// happens. The pieces the operator is looking at live in two places at once: the
// worker's copy, which is what the instruction above throws away, and the
// browser's own copy already uploaded to the graphics card, which is what is
// actually drawn. The engine throws both away together, and only the first of
// those two is necessary. So this keeps the second: the picture already on the
// screen stays on the screen, and each piece of it is exchanged for its
// replacement at the moment that replacement finishes downloading. Nothing is
// ever drawn from two generations of the data at once, because the exchange
// happens one piece at a time and each piece is whole.

 * you decoded from this source" — and that single message is the whole of the
 * blank. This intercepts exactly that one message and answers it by remembering
 * what was on screen instead of clearing it.
 *

 * ever. A replacement announces itself by arriving under a name that is already
 * in use, which is what the second half of this function watches for.
 *
 * And a piece that is kept but never asked for again — ground the operator has
 * scrolled away from, which the engine has no reason to fetch a second time —
