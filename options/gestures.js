/**
 * The two ways of moving around, and the one place a drag can be lent out.
 *
 * `viz_studio/CONTROLS.md` settles this for the flat view: **dragging pans, and
 * the plain scroll wheel zooms.** Everything else that could change where the
 * operator is or which way they are facing has been taken away — rotating with
 * shift and drag, rotating with the `r` and `e` keys, tilting with shift and the
 * arrow keys, stepping through the stack on the wheel, zooming with ctrl and the
 * wheel, and recentring with the right button. Moving through the stack and
 * through time is not lost; it moves to sliders, where it is visible and
 * labelled rather than living on a gesture an operator has to be told about.
 *
 * **This file belongs to the canvas, and all three options use this one copy.**
 * That is deliberate and it is the property to protect. If each option decided
 * for itself how far a wheel notch should zoom or how a drag should follow the
 * hand, a difference in how the three feel might be the engine or might be
 * somebody's idea of a good number, and there would be no way to tell which.
 * Driven by one file, a difference is a difference in the engine. It is also why
 * a page that embeds the canvas gets the two gestures without writing a line:
 * `openViewer` puts these listeners on, `destroy` takes them off, and the page
 * hears where the view went through `onViewChanged`.
 *
 * The listeners go on the box the viewer was opened inside, rather than on any
 * surface the option laid down in it. Events from whatever is in there bubble up
 * to the box, so this works the same whether the option put down two canvases or
 * one — and the box is measured here rather than being described by each option,
 * so there is one less thing the three could disagree about.
 *
 * **Every refusal is written out on purpose rather than simply left
 * unimplemented**, and each one is counted. An unbound gesture and a gesture
 * nobody tried look exactly alike on screen, so a measurement has to be able to
 * tell them apart, and the only way to do that is for the canvas to say plainly
 * what it turned away.
 *
 * ## Lending a drag out
 *
 * A drag that draws cannot also pan, so an operator who wants to scribble on the
 * picture needs some way to say which of the two they mean. The answer here is
 * the one every drawing program an operator has ever used already takes: **the
 * application chooses the tool, and the canvas obeys.** The canvas keeps the
 * mechanics of the gesture — which button, when the drag began, where the
 * pointer is on the stage — and knows nothing whatever about why the meaning
 * changed. `handDragsTo(handler)` is the whole of the mechanism: hand over a
 * function and the canvas stops panning and gives each drag to it instead; hand
 * over nothing and dragging pans again, which is what it does until somebody
 * says otherwise. Nothing here draws anything; what a lent drag is *for* is the
 * application's business entirely.
