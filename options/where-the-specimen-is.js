/**
 * Where the specimen actually is, as against where the run declared room for it.
 *
 * Shared by every option, the way `planes.js` and `brightness.js` are, and for
 * the same reason: it is a fact about the file rather than about a drawing
 * engine.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A run declares the ground it might cover and then images part of it. Opening on
 * the middle of the declared ground is therefore opening on the middle of the
 * *room*, which is only the middle of the specimen when the specimen fills it.
 *
 * Measured on a 75 GB skin biopsy: the tissue's centre of mass sits at plane 467
 * of 833 where the declared middle is 417, and at 56% and 54% of the height and
 * width where the declared middle is 50%. So the view opened about 250 µm away
 * from the specimen in depth and a couple of hundred laterally.
 *
 * On a flat picture that is a slightly off-centre opening view, which an operator
 * corrects with one drag and never thinks about again. **In a volume it is the
 * point the specimen turns about**, and turning something about a point outside
 * it makes it swing rather than rotate — which is how this was noticed, by
 * somebody rotating a biopsy and saying the centre looked wrong.
 *
 * It is the same fault as three others met the same day, and worth naming as one:
 * a *declared* extent standing in for what is actually there. The first plane of
 * a stack, the camera's full range as a display window, the middle of a declared
 * canvas — each read the description where it should have read the picture.
 *
 * ## What it reads, and what it costs
 *
 * The smallest copy in the pyramid, whole. That is the one read where reading all
 * of it is cheap — a few hundred thousand numbers for a store of tens of
 * gigabytes — and where the averaging that makes coarse copies useless for
 * *extremes* is harmless: a centre of mass is a bulk property, and averaging
 * neighbours barely moves it.
 *
 * Everything below a floor is discarded before weighing, because background is
 * most of a light-sheet acquisition by volume and would drag the answer back
 * towards the middle of the room — which is the very thing being corrected.
