// After the page is built, put neuroglancer's second background worker where it
// is actually loaded from.
//
// Neuroglancer uses a second kind of worker for decompression — unpacking the
// compressed pieces of image. The main worker loads it at run time from
// "../async_computation.bundle.js" relative to its own place, which comes out as
// the root of the site. Vite does not emit that file on its own, so without this
// step the decompression worker is answered with a 404: pieces of image are
// fetched and never decoded, and the picture never fills in. Nothing errors.
//
// `frontend/precompile-workers.mjs` has already compiled a real, self-contained
// worker into the neuroglancer package; this copies it into the built page.
