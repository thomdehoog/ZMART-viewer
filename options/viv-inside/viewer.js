/**
 * Option C: no sandwich at all. The acquired picture and the operator's own
 * drawing are layers in a *single* canvas, drawn in one pass from one view.
 *
 * The other two options put two drawing surfaces in the page, one exactly on
 * top of the other, and then work hard to keep them in step: the operator's
 * canvas is repainted only from inside the engine's end-of-frame announcement,
 * using the view read at that instant, because anything less lets the two come
 * apart while the view is moved. That discipline was measured holding them
 * together to one screen pixel, which is very good — but it is a thing that has
 * to keep being true.
 *
 * Here there is nothing to keep in step. Viv's image layers and the operator's
 * drawing are handed to deck.gl together, as one list of layers with one view
 * behind them, and deck.gl draws them into one canvas in one pass. A frame
 * cannot show the picture from one moment and the drawing from another, because
 * there is only one moment in it. That is what "exact by construction" means,
 * and it is the whole reason this option is worth building.
 *
 * ## The three things that had to be worked out to make that true
 *
 * **1. The operator's drawing is a rectangle of specimen, not a sheet over the
 * window.** The page draws in two dimensions with a plain drawing context, and
 * deck.gl has no such thing — it draws layers, not strokes. So the page's
 * drawing goes into an ordinary offscreen canvas, and that canvas is handed to
 * deck.gl as an image pinned to the exact rectangle of specimen the window is
 * showing. The picture and the drawing are then two layers over the same ground,
 * placed by the same view in the same pass. The page's drawing code does not
 * change by a character, and is never told which option it is running under —
 * see `drawOver` at the bottom of this file, and the long note there about why
 * this was chosen over the alternatives.
 *
 * The same trick serves the bottom layer of `viz_studio/THE_CANVAS.md`, and here
 * it is at its most natural. `drawUnder(paint)` takes a second offscreen canvas
 * and puts it into the same list of layers *before* the picture rather than
 * after, so the ground, the acquisition and the operator's marks are three
 * layers in one canvas drawn in one pass. There is no question of the bottom
 * layer being covered by an opaque canvas, because there is only one canvas, and
 * no question of it drifting, because all three are placed from the same
 * numbers in the same frame. `viewer.drawsUnder` is `true` here.
 *
 * **2. Ground nobody has imaged had to be made see-through.** Viv paints the
 * whole of a run's declared canvas, and a run declares generously, so most of
 * that canvas is room the microscope has never visited. Viv's colouring ends by
 * setting the transparency to "fully opaque" whatever the brightness, so left
 * alone it would paint every unvisited square black — and in a single canvas
 * that black would cover the operator's own drawing. A dozen lines added to the
 * little program Viv runs on the graphics card — a shader, in the engine's own
 * word, and the thing that decides what colour each spot comes out — fix it:
 * where nothing was recorded, nothing is painted. See
 * `LetTheUnimagedGroundShowThrough` below, including what the fix costs and the
 * measured surprise that where the run kept a coverage record it is not needed
 * at all.
 *
 * **3. Nothing on disk announces a new tile.** A run declares its images at full
 * size before the first tile exists, and their description is identical before
 * and after, so there is nothing for a watcher to notice. Viv has to be handed a
 * freshly opened reader, and only one such read is allowed to be in flight at a
 * time. See `tilesMayHaveLanded` and `openTheStoresAgain`.
 *
 * ## Please keep Viv behind this file
 *
 * This is the only file in the application that knows Viv or deck.gl exist.
 * Everything around it — the page, the two gestures in `../gestures.js`, the
 * carrier outline, the tile rectangles, the measurements — is written against
 * the small interface in `../contract.md`, and works the same whichever of the three options is
 * underneath. That is what makes comparing them fair: a difference somebody
 * feels tomorrow is then a difference in the approach, and not a difference in
 * how somebody happened to wire one of them up.

// what colour to draw it in, and how bright to open it — and where it does, what
// it says is used exactly as given. But a page usually has no way of knowing any
// of that, because the description lives inside the store, which is the very
// thing it is asking this viewer to open. Making the page find out would mean
// opening the run twice: once by the page, to learn what to say, and once by the
// viewer, to draw it.
//
// So where the page says nothing, the description is read here instead, out of
// the `omero` block that every image this project writes carries.
// `zmart_storage/canvas.py` is where it is written, and it holds one entry per
// channel: a label, a colour as six hex digits, and a brightness window.
//
// Leaving this out has a plain and visible cost. With nothing to go on a viewer
// falls back to a single white channel, so **a run recorded in two colours shows
// only its first one**, in white, and nothing on screen says that the rest of
// the acquisition is missing.
//
// The four pieces below are word for word the same in all three options, on
// purpose. The three are meant to be comparable, and a difference in how they
// read the same description would show up in the results as a difference
// between the engines, which it is not. Two copies can drift apart, so **if you
// change one of these four, change the other two files to match in the same
// commit.**

/**
 * Let ground nobody has imaged show what is beneath it, instead of painting it
 * black.
 *
 * **What it is fixing.** A run declares room to the reach of the stage before it
 * images anything, because room nobody writes into costs nothing, and then
 * fills a small part of it in. Viv draws that whole declared canvas, and the
 * last thing its colouring does is set the transparency to "fully opaque"
 * regardless of how bright the spot is. In its own viewer that is right — there
 * is nothing underneath to reveal. Here there is: the operator's carrier, their
 * wells and their planned tiles are all drawn under the picture, and left alone
 * the picture would paint black rectangles over every part of the plan the
 * microscope has not yet visited.
 *
 * **What it does.** After the colour has been worked out, it takes the
 * brightest of the three colour channels and fades the transparency to nothing
 * as that approaches zero. Nothing recorded means nothing painted. Measured
 * with a colour painted behind the canvas and nothing of the operator's own
 * drawn over it, this takes what an operator sees over ground nobody imaged
 * from 90.5% that colour and 6.5% black to 96.9% that colour and no black at
 * all. On a canvas eight thousand voxels across with a small patch imaged in
 * it, the difference is starker still: without this, the band of page colour
 * around the patch is painted over entirely and the registration measurement
 * cannot find it, reporting only that the band had closed.
 *
 * **The surprise, which is worth more than the fix.** Where the run kept a
 * coverage record, none of this is needed. `onlyWhereTheRunHasImaged` below
 * refuses to ask for a piece of image over ground the run has not imaged, so
 * Viv is given nothing to draw there and draws nothing — transparency stops
 * being computed from brightness and becomes structural. Taking this shader out
 * altogether changed no measurement taken with the coverage record in use.
 * That is the arrangement `viz_studio/OPTIONS.md` describes under "Nothing is
 * drawn until something is there", arrived at here by a different route, and it
 * is the arrangement that ships. This shader is what keeps a run that kept *no*
 * record from blacking out the operator's plan.
 *
 * **What it costs, so that it is chosen rather than discovered.** It asks the
 * pixels how bright they are, and a place that genuinely *was* imaged and came
 * back black looks exactly like a place nobody has visited — so a truly dark
 * specimen would disappear along with the empty room. That is a real cost and
 * it is not this file's to fix: `viz_studio/OPTIONS.md` sets out the two ways to
 * take the ambiguity away for good, under "Telling imaged-and-dark from
 * never-visited", and records that the decision has not been taken.
 *
 * The fade is soft rather than a sharp cut, over the first two per cent of the
 * brightness window, because a sharp cut leaves a hard jagged edge wherever the
 * specimen fades out into background.

     * view that frame is being drawn from. The page never knows which option is
     * underneath it, which is what makes comparing the three fair.
     *
     * ## Why an offscreen canvas, and what was considered instead
     *
     * deck.gl has no two-dimensional drawing context to offer: it draws layers,
     * not strokes. So something had to give, and `contract.md` is explicit about
     * what must not: **the page's drawing code**. A viewer that needed its own
     * version of the operator's drawing would make the comparison meaningless,
     * because a difference somebody felt might then be the drawing rather than
     * the approach.
     *
     * What is done here is what `contract.md` suggests, with one change worth
     * explaining. The page draws into an ordinary offscreen canvas, and that
     * canvas is composited inside the single pass. The change is *how* it is
     * composited: rather than being stretched over the window, it is handed to
     * deck.gl as an image occupying the exact rectangle of specimen the window
     * is showing. It is therefore placed by the same view, in the same pass, as
     * the picture — so the two cannot come apart even in principle, which is the
     * property this whole option exists to demonstrate.
     *
     * Two other ways were considered and set aside. Drawing the operator's
     * shapes as deck.gl layers of their own — a path layer for the carrier, a
     * polygon layer for the tiles — would be the natural deck.gl way, and it is
     * ruled out for exactly the reason above: it would mean this option drawing
     * something different from the other two. Compositing the canvas over the
     * top afterwards, outside deck.gl's pass, would reintroduce the second
     * surface and everything that goes with keeping two surfaces in step, which
     * is the thing this option is here to do without.
